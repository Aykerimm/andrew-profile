<p class="about__p">
    My research draws on methods and tools from demography and epidemiology to answer questions within the population health sciences.
    My substantive areas of interest are in health and aging across the life course, mortality inequalities, and cause of death estimation.
    I am also interested in research methods, including spatial epidemiology, small area estimation, hierarchical models, and causal inference.

<p class="about__p">
    Founded in response to the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020,
    I lead a project focused on quantifying uncounted Covid-19 deaths in local communities across the United States.
    Through peer-reviewed research, media collaborations, and public data dashboards,
    the project seeks to reveal the hidden death toll of the pandemic and inform public health policies that center health equity.
