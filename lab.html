        Founded in response to the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the Vital Statistics Lab strives to inform the public and policymakers about the true mortality impact of the Covid-19 impact on communities across the United States. Through peer-reviewed research, media collaborations, and public data dashboards, the project seeks to reveal the hidden death toll of the pandemic and inform public health policies that center equity.
