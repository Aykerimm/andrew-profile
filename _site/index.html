            <p class="about__p">I am a demographer and sociologist with expertise in population health and aging. My research falls into five areas:
    <i>(1) Excess mortality during the Covid-19 pandemic</i>,
    <i>(2) Determinants of mortality and life expectancy trends</i>,
    <i>(3) Chronic disease, pain, and disability across the life course</i>,
    <i>(4) Substance use, tobacco, and e-cigarettes, (5) Access to care for chronic diseases in low- and middle-income countries.</i>
</p>
<br>
<p class="about__p">Through my research and dissemination efforts, I strive to reveal the social and structural factors that influence health across the life course, inform public health policies that center health equity, and contribute to evidence-based reforms of public health administrative systems such as the death investigation system.</p>
