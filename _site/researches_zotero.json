In South Africa, the government has employed a whole systems approach to address the growing burden of non-communicable diseases. We used a novel incident care cascade approach to measure changes in the South African health system's ability to manage hypertension between 2008 and 2017.MethodsWe used data from Waves 1-5 of the National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS) to estimate trends in the hypertension care cascade and unmet treatment need across four successive cohorts with incident hypertension. We used a negative binomial regression to identify factors that may predict higher rates of hypertension control, controlling for socio-demographic and healthcare factors. The largest cascade attrition occurred prior to diagnosis.ResultsIn 2011, 19·6% (95%CI 14·2, 26·2) of individuals with incident hypertension were diagnosed, 15·4% (95%CI 10·8, 21·4) were on treatment and 7.1% had controlled blood pressure. By 2017, the proportion of individuals with diagnosed incident hypertension had increased to 24·4% (95%CI 15·9, 35·4) with increases in treatment (23·3%, 95%CI 15·0, 34·3) and control (22·1%, 95%CI 14·1, 33·.0) were also observed, translating to a decrease in unmet need from 92·9% in 2011 to 77·9% in 2017. Multivariable regression showed that participants with incident hypertension in 2017 were 3·01 (95%CI 1·77, 5·13) times more likely to have a controlled blood pressure compared to those in 2011.ConclusionsThe proportion of people with incident hypertension who successfully progressed to controlled blood pressure tripled between 2011 and 2017 in South Africa. Despite these improvements, a low absolute proportion of the population were able to control their blood pressure and a high burden of unmet need remains.Summary BoxWhat is already knownPrevalent cascades provide insight to where losses in care cascades occur.While mostly used in the management of HIV, recently they have also been adopted in studying the management of non-communicable diseases on a population level.Prevalent hypertension cascades in South Africa showed a high burden of unmet need, with the biggest losses where lost between disease development and diagnosis.What are the new findingsIncident hypertension cascades improved from 2008 to 2017 in South Africa.What do the new findings implyIncident cascades provide an improved means to measure changes in management cascades as this allows us to distinguish between historical and current health system performance.Our data show that while substantial improvements in the care cascade occurred between 2008 and 2017, a large burden of unmet need remains.","manuscriptType":"","place":"","date":"2021-09","numPages":"","language":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"Publication Title: bioRxiv","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:20Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:20Z"}},{"key":"2LMKH8ER","version":14,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/2LMKH8ER","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/2LMKH8ER","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Chen et al.","parsedDate":"2022-02","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"2LMKH8ER","version":14,"itemType":"manuscript","title":"COVID-19 mortality and excess mortality among working-age Californians, by occupational sector: March 2020 through November 2021","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Yea-Hung","lastName":"Chen"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Alicia R","lastName":"Riley"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Kate A","lastName":"Duchowny"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Hélène E","lastName":"Aschmann"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Ruijia","lastName":"Chen"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Mathew V","lastName":"Kiang"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Alyssa","lastName":"Mooney"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew C","lastName":"Stokes"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"M Maria","lastName":"Glymour"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Kirsten","lastName":"Bibbins-Domingo"}],"abstractNote":"AbstractBackgroundDuring the first year of the pandemic, essential workers faced higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 mortality than non-essential workers.

We used data from 3975 adults aged 25–74 years who completed self-administered questionnaires (SAQs) for the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) National Study Wave 2 (2004–2006). Loneliness was measured by asking participants how often they felt lonely. A shortened version of the Berkman-Syme Social Network Index that captured partnerships, friends/family, religious participation, and other forms of social connection was used to assess social isolation. Follow-up for all-cause mortality was censored at the end of 2016. We used progressively adjusted Cox proportional hazard models to examine the mortality risks of loneliness, social isolation, the components of social isolation, and combinations of loneliness and isolation. We adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics in our first models and then added health behaviors and physical and mental health conditions in subsequent models. In the minimally adjusted model, loneliness was associated with higher mortality risk (HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.22–1.47), but the association was not significant in the fully adjusted model. Social isolation was significantly associated with mortality in the minimally adjusted model (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.15–1.34) and the fully adjusted model (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.04–1.23). Having infrequent contact with family or friends was the component of isolation that had the strongest association with mortality. Contrary to prior literature, which has found either no interaction or a synergistic interaction between isolation and loneliness, we identified a significant, negative interaction between the two measures, indicating that loneliness and social isolation may partially substitute for one another as risk factors for mortality. Both are associated with a similar increased risk of mortality relative to those who express neither; we find no evidence that the combined effect is worse than experiencing either by itself.","publicationTitle":"SSM - Mental Health","volume":"1","issue":"","pages":"100014","date":"2021-12","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"Publisher: Elsevier","tags":[{"tag":"Interaction"},{"tag":"Loneliness"},{"tag":"Mortality"},{"tag":"Social isolation"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:20Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:20Z"}},{"key":"XZ7UU9Z8","version":14,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/XZ7UU9Z8","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/XZ7UU9Z8","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Stokes","parsedDate":"2011-02","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"XZ7UU9Z8","version":14,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Body-mass index and mortality among white adults","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"A C","lastName":"Stokes"}],"abstractNote":"","publicationTitle":"N.

Using multiple waves of population-based cohort data from four MICs (China, Indonesia, Mexico, and South Africa), we undertook a longitudinal investigation into how individuals with hypertension move through care over time. We classified adults aged 40 years and over (N = 8527) into care stages at both baseline and follow-up waves and estimated the probability of transitioning between stages using Poisson regression models. Over a 5- to 9-year follow-up period, only around 30% of undiagnosed individuals became diagnosed [Mexico, 27% (95% confidence interval: 23%, 31%); China, 30% (26%, 33%); Indonesia, 30% (28%, 32%); and South Africa, 36% (31%, 41%)], and one in four untreated individuals became treated [Indonesia, 11% (10%, 12%); Mexico, 24% (20%, 28%); China, 26% (23%, 29%); and South Africa, 33% (29%, 38%)]. The probability of reaching blood pressure (BP) control was lower [Indonesia, 2% (1%, 2%); China, 9% (7%, 11%); Mexico, 12% (9%, 14%); and South Africa, 24% (20%, 28%)] regardless of treatment status. A substantial proportion of individuals discontinued treatment [Indonesia, 70% (67%, 73%); China, 36% (32%, 40%); Mexico, 34% (29%, 39%); and South Africa, 20% (15%, 25%)], and most individuals lost BP control by follow-up [Indonesia, 92% (89%, 96%); Mexico, 77% (71%, 83%); China, 76% (69%, 83%); and South Africa 45% (36%, 54%)]. Our results highlight that policies solely aimed at improving diagnosis or initiating treatment may not lead to long-term hypertension control improvements in MICs. Across four middle-income countries, many individuals diagnosed with hypertension stop treatment and most of them lose blood pressure control over 5 to 9 years. Middle-income countries (MICs) face a disproportionately high burden of hypertension, as well as considerable population aging. It is therefore critical to understand how individuals move through hypertension care stages. Here, Mauer and colleagues longitudinally assessed how individuals with hypertension move through care by using waves of cohort data from China, Indonesia, Mexico, and South Africa. They found that only about 25% of untreated individuals became treated, whereas most individuals lost blood pressure control over the course of the study, and many discontinued treatment altogether. These findings highlight the challenges faced by MICs in trying to improve hypertension control and suggest that different approaches, beyond improving diagnosis and initiating treatment, are needed.","publicationTitle":"Sci.

We provide the first longitudinal investigation of how individuals with hypertension move through the care continuum over time across multiple MICs.MethodsWe used multiple waves of population-based longitudinal cohort data from China, Indonesia, Mexico and South Africa. Based on measured blood pressure and information on hypertension diagnosis and treatment status, we classified adults aged 40 + into four care stages at both the baseline and follow-up waves: undiagnosed; diagnosed and untreated; diagnosed, treated, but uncontrolled (systolic blood pressure (SBP) $\\geq$ 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) $\\geq$ 90 mmHg); diagnosed, treated, and controlled (SBP FindingsOur data included 8359 individuals with hypertension (China: N=1371, Indonesia: N= 3438, Mexico: N=1946, South Africa: N=1604). Across all countries, there was a less than 50% probability of forward progression through the care continuum over time. Just over one in four undiagnosed individuals became diagnosed (China 30% [95% CI 26-33%], Indonesia 30% [95% CI 28-32%], Mexico 27% [95% CI 25-29%], South Africa 37% [95% CI 34-39%]) and one in three diagnosed, untreated individuals became treated (Indonesia 17% [95% CI 14-21%], Mexico 30% [95% CI 28-32%], China 48% [95% CI 39-56%], South Africa 42% [95% CI 40-44%]). Importantly, there were very high probabilities of regressing to less advanced continuum stages: up to nine in ten treated and controlled individuals lost blood pressure control (Indonesia 92% [95% CI 88-95%], Mexico 77% [95% CI 72-81%], China 76% [95% CI 68-83%], South Africa 48% [95% CI 42-54%]) and up to three in four individuals discontinued treatment over the follow-up period (China 36% [95% CI 32-41%], Indonesia 70% [95% CI 67-73%], Mexico 34% [5% CI 32-36%], South Africa 25% [23-27%]). Individuals from rural households were disadvantaged in all countries but China, while females were more likely to progress through the continuum in Indonesia and Mexico.InterpretationOur results uncover critical gaps in hypertension care in MICs in both early and late stages of the continuum. Adopting a longitudinal perspective reveals that policies solely aimed at improving diagnosis or initiating treatment may not lead to large improvements in control, as treatment initiation rates are low and achievement of blood pressure control and adherence to therapy are rarely sustained over time.RESEARCH IN CONTEXTEvidence before this studyWe searched PubMed for articles published from database inception until January 1st, 2021 using variations of the search terms “blood pressure”, “hypertension”, “continuum”, “cascade”, “treatment”, “diagnosis”, “control”, “treated”, “diagnosed”, “controlled” to screen titles and abstracts. The currently largest studies estimating nationally representative levels of hypertension diagnosis, treatment and control across multiple low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study from 2013, which included 140 000 individuals across 14 LMICs and a more recent study based on 1·1 million adults in 44 LMICs from 2019. Both studies highlight important gaps in awareness, diagnosis, treatment and control of hypertension across populations in LMICs. However, these and smaller non-nationally representative or single country studies are all based on cross-sectional data and none capture the dynamic nature of chronic disease care and how individuals move through the hypertension care continuum over time.Added value of this studyTo our knowledge, we provide the first longitudinal evidence on how individuals with hypertension in middle-income countries (MICs) move through the hypertension care continuum over time using country-wide, longitudinal cohort data from four MICs, which span three different continents and account for close to one-fourth of the world population. The longitudinal perspective provides new insights over existing cross-sectional cascades by capturing critical dynamic elements of chronic disease management, such as how individuals arrived at a specific continuum stage or whether they move forward or backward through continuum stages over time.Implications of all available evidenceOur results reveal that individuals rarely sustain blood pressure control and that they tend to discontinue treatment over time. These results can inform efforts to improve hypertension control by revealing the need to move beyond policies aimed solely at screening and diagnosis to those that also aim to help individuals sustain blood pressure control over time.","manuscriptType":"","place":"","date":"2021-05","numPages":"","language":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"Publication Title: medRxiv","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:20Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:20Z"}},{"key":"5D6IP26T","version":14,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/5D6IP26T","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/5D6IP26T","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Stokes et al.","parsedDate":"2019-04","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"5D6IP26T","version":14,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Trends in prescription pain management among us adults with arthritis or back pain, 1999-2014","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"A","lastName":"Stokes"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"K M","lastName":"Berry"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"K","lastName":"Hempstead"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"T","lastName":"Neogi"}],"abstractNote":"Purpose: Joint and back pain are now among the most common reasons for outpatient medical visits.

We investigated the relationship between these 2 phenomena. METHODS: We estimated the fraction of deaths attributable to obesity by country, age, and sex and reestimated life tables after removing these deaths. To allow for a possible secular decline in obesity risks, we employed alternative risks from a more recent period. RESULTS: In our baseline analysis, obesity reduced US life expectancy at age 50 years in 2006 by 1.54 years (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.37, 1.93) for women and by 1.85 years (95% CI = 1.62, 2.10) for men. Removing the effects of obesity reduced the US shortfall by 42% (95% CI = 36, 48) for women and 67% (95% CI = 57, 76) for men, relative to countries with higher life expectancies. Using more recently recorded risk data, we estimated that differences in obesity still accounted for a fifth to a third of the shortfall. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of obesity in the United States contributes substantially to its poor international ranking in longevity.","publicationTitle":"Am. J.

Emerging evidence suggests this trend may extend to e-cigarettes. The current study evaluated the relationship between sexual identity and prevalence of e-cigarette, cigarette, and cannabis use and whether such associations differ by gender. METHODS: Cross-sectional, regionally representative data of young adults (M[SD]age = 20.02 [0.60] years; n heterosexual = 1314; n bisexual = 77; n lesbian/gay = 28) from Wave III (2016) of the Southern California Children's Health Study were analyzed in 2019. Logistic regression analyses were conducted with sexual identity as the predictor and product use (never, prior, infrequent past 30-day [1-2 days], frequent past 30-day [3-5+ days]) as the outcome in separate models by substance (e-cigarettes, cigarettes, cannabis). RESULTS: Bisexual individuals were the highest-risk sub-group for nearly all outcomes, with over five times the odds of reporting frequent past 30-day use for e-cigarettes (Odds Ratio [OR]: 6.68; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 2.80, 15.9), cigarettes (OR: 5.42; 95% CI: 2.37, 12.4), and cannabis (OR: 8.43; 95% CI: 4.40, 16.1) compared to heterosexual individuals. Although the sample size for lesbian/gay participants was small, bisexual (vs. lesbian/gay) participants also had greater odds of reporting prior use of nicotine products and frequent past 30-day cannabis use. A significant sexual identity $\\times$ gender interaction emerged for lifetime cigarette use, wherein bisexual (vs. heterosexual) identity was only associated with greater odds of use for females (p < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Sexual minority-related disparities in substance use among young adults appear to generalize to e-cigarettes, with bisexual young adults exhibiting especially high profiles of risk.","publicationTitle":"Addict Behav Rep","volume":"13","issue":"","pages":"100338","date":"2021-06","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Cannabis smoking"},{"tag":"Cigarette smoking"},{"tag":"E-cigarette use"},{"tag":"Health status disparities"},{"tag":"Sexual minorities"},{"tag":"Young adult"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:19Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:19Z"}},{"key":"WGSXNBCS","version":13,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/WGSXNBCS","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/WGSXNBCS","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Carlesso et al.","parsedDate":"2019-04","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"WGSXNBCS","version":13,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Is the association of body mass index with opioid use mediated by number of painful joints or depressive symptoms: the multicenter osteoarthritis study","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"L C","lastName":"Carlesso"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"R","lastName":"Jafarzadeh"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"A","lastName":"Stokes"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"D","lastName":"Felson"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"N","lastName":"Wang"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"N A","lastName":"Segal"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"L","lastName":"Frey-Law"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"C E","lastName":"Lewis"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"M","lastName":"Nevitt"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"T","lastName":"Neogi"}],"abstractNote":"Purpose: The association between higher body mass index (BMI) and the presence of multi- joint pain has been well documented in the literature.

An alternative and less often examined explanation is that these trends reflect, at least in part, the lagged effects of the obesity epidemic. Adults in midlife today are more likely to live with obesity and have a greater cumulative exposure to excess adiposity during their lifetime than any previous generation. Prior work has demonstrated a link between obesity and mortality risk at midlife, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Pain may represent one important pathway linking obesity to mortality trends. Pain is a debilitating condition that has increased significantly over recent decades and is associated with both morbidity and mortality, including suicide and opioid-related mortality. Evidence suggests obesity and pain may be linked, but there is little evidence of an association at the population level. In this paper, we examine to what extent increases in overweight and obesity explain the rising trends in chronic pain observed among middle-aged adults in the US from 1992 to 2016. We assess trends in both mild/moderate nonlimiting pain and severe and/or limiting pain. In doing so, we draw attention to one mechanism through which overweight/obesity may have contributed to recent population health trends. Our analysis found that increases in BMI from 1992 to 2016 may account for up to 20% of the upward trend in mild/moderate nonlimiting pain and 32% of the trend in severe and/or limiting pain for women, and 10% and 19% of the trends respectively for men.","publicationTitle":"SSM Popul Health","volume":"12","issue":"","pages":"100644","date":"2020-12","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Activity limitations"},{"tag":"Obesity"},{"tag":"Pain"},{"tag":"Trends"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:19Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:19Z"}},{"key":"X8PTMEFF","version":13,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/X8PTMEFF","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/X8PTMEFF","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Uddin et al.","parsedDate":"2020-10","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"X8PTMEFF","version":13,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Prevalence, Trends, and Distribution of Nicotine and Marijuana use in E-cigarettes among US adults: The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 2016–2018","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"S M Iftekhar","lastName":"Uddin"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Albert D","lastName":"Osei"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Olufunmilayo H","lastName":"Obisesan"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Omar","lastName":"El-Shahawy"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Omar","lastName":"Dzaye"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Miguel","lastName":"Cainzos-Achirica"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Mohammadhassan","lastName":"Mirbolouk"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Olusola A","lastName":"Orimoloye"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Stokes"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Emelia J","lastName":"Benjamin"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Aruni","lastName":"Bhatnagar"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew P","lastName":"DeFilippis"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Travis S","lastName":"Henry"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Khurram","lastName":"Nasir"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Michael J","lastName":"Blaha"}],"abstractNote":"Use of substances other than nicotine in e-cigarettes, especially marijuana, is becoming increasingly popular in the US. However, population-representative data on such poly-use (nicotine and marijuana) remains limited. We therefore conducted a cross-sectional logistic regression analysis of the 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System among 16 US states/territories with data on past 30-day marijuana use to describe the emerging dual nicotine and marijuana vaping population. We additionally examined trends in marijuana use, including marijuana vaping, from 2016 to 2018. Of the 131,807 participants studied, 3068 were current e-cigarette users, among whom 7.1% also vaped marijuana. Prevalence of nicotine-predominant, dual nicotine marijuana, and marijuana-predominant vaping was 3.36%, 0.38% and 1.09%, respectively. Compared to nicotine-predominant vapers, dual and marijuana-predominant vapers were older, had greater proportions of non-Whites, particularly Hispanics, and less likely to be current smokers (nicotine-predominant vs dual vs marijuana-predominant vaping: current tobacco use 44.7 vs 23.7 vs 11.1%). Proportion of dual vapers among current e-cigarette users was 8.6%, 2.6% and 7.1% for 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. Prevalence of marijuana use increased from 8.97% (2016) to 13.1% (2018) while no clear trend was observed for marijuana vaping. Dual nicotine and marijuana vaping is prevalent in the US, and compared to predominantly nicotine vapers such users have higher mean ages, and are more likely to be Blacks, Hispanics, and never cigarette smokers. Marijuana use overall increased from 2016 to 2018. Dual vapers represent a large and important emerging population that will require dedicated study of health effects and tailored regulatory strategies.","publicationTitle":"Prev.

However, the impact of obesity on prescription opioid use is not well known. This study investigates the association between obesity and incidence of long-term prescription opioid use. METHODS: Fifteen panels of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey from 2000 to 2015 were pooled to generate a sample of civilian non-institutionalized adults aged 30-84 years who were prescription opioid-naïve for approximately 9 months. Incident long-term prescription opioid use was defined as reporting use at 2 of 3 interviews during a 15-month follow-up. BMI was reported at baseline. Analyses were completed in 2019. RESULTS: Among opioid-naïve adults (n=89,629), obesity was strongly associated with incident long-term prescription opioid use. The association increased at progressively higher BMI values, with 24% elevated odds (95% CI=7%, 44%) in adults with overweight (25-29.9 kg/m2) and 158% increased odds (95% CI=106%, 224%) among adults with Class III obesity (40-49.9 kg/m2). These associations grew with higher-dosage opioids. Of the reasons for opioid use, joint pain, back pain, injury, and muscle/nerve pain contributed the most to the excess use observed among adults with obesity. At the population level, 27.0% of incident long-term prescription opioid use (95% CI=19.0%, 34.8%) was attributable to adults having a BMI above normal weight (25-49.9 kg/m2). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that obesity has contributed to prescription opioid use in the U.S. Future investments in chronic pain reduction may benefit from increased integration with obesity prevention and treatment.","publicationTitle":"Am.

Diabetes prevalence and the subset with undiagnosed diabetes was calculated overall and by country, World Bank income group (WBIG), and geographic region. Multivariable Poisson regression models were used to estimate relative risk (RR). RESULTS: Overall, prevalence of diabetes in 29 LMICs was 7.5% (95% CI 7.1-8.0) and of undiagnosed diabetes 4.9% (4.6-5.3). Diabetes prevalence increased with increasing WBIG: countries with low-income economies (LICs) 6.7% (5.5-8.1), lower-middle-income economies (LMIs) 7.1% (6.6-7.6), and upper-middle-income economies (UMIs) 8.2% (7.5-9.0). Compared with no formal education, greater educational attainment was associated with an increased risk of diabetes across WBIGs, after adjusting for BMI (LICs RR 1.47 [95% CI 1.22-1.78], LMIs 1.14 [1.06-1.23], and UMIs 1.28 [1.02-1.61]). CONCLUSIONS: Among 29 LMICs, diabetes prevalence was substantial and increased with increasing WBIG. In contrast to the association seen in high-income countries, diabetes risk was highest among those with greater educational attainment, independent of BMI. LMICs included in this analysis may be at an advanced stage in the nutrition transition but with no reversal in the socioeconomic gradient of diabetes risk.","publicationTitle":"Diabetes Care","volume":"43","issue":"4","pages":"767–775","date":"2020-04","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"Publisher: Am Diabetes Assoc","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:19Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:19Z"}},{"key":"9JEVIUIS","version":13,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/9JEVIUIS","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/9JEVIUIS","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Landry et al.","parsedDate":"2019-12","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"9JEVIUIS","version":13,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The role of flavors in vaping initiation and satisfaction among U.S. adults","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Robyn L","lastName":"Landry"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Allison L","lastName":"Groom"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Thanh-Huyen T","lastName":"Vu"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew C","lastName":"Stokes"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Kaitlyn M","lastName":"Berry"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Anshula","lastName":"Kesh"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Joy L","lastName":"Hart"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Kandi L","lastName":"Walker"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Aida L","lastName":"Giachello"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Clara G","lastName":"Sears"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Kathleen L","lastName":"McGlasson"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Lindsay K","lastName":"Tompkins"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Delvon T","lastName":"Mattingly"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Rose Marie","lastName":"Robertson"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Thomas J","lastName":"Payne"}],"abstractNote":"Background The prevalence of electronic cigarette use has grown over the past decade, with some users reportedly initiating e-cigarette use primarily due to flavors. This study examined the role of flavors in initiation among adult e-cigarette users, as well as the association of flavors with satisfaction and perceived addiction to vaping. Methods The analysis sample consisted of 1492 current e-cigarette users aged 18 or older, drawn from an online quantitative survey conducted in 2016. Multivariable logistic regression and general linear models were used. Results Most current e-cigarette users (62.9%) typically used flavors other than tobacco (including fruit, mint/menthol, sweet, candy, coffee and other), 24.2% typically used tobacco flavors, and 12.9% typically used non-flavored e-cigarettes. Flavor was a common reason for vaping initiation, selected by 29.5% of the sample. Flavor, particularly fruit flavor, was more likely to motivate young adults 18–24 to initiate vaping compared adults 35–44. Those who used flavors, particularly mint/menthol and flavors other than tobacco flavor, had higher odds of reporting high satisfaction with vaping and had higher odds of perceived addiction to vaping than respondents who did not use flavored e-cigarettes. Conclusions Users of flavored e-cigarettes reported greater satisfaction and self-perceived addiction than users of non-flavored e-cigarettes. The appeal of flavors, particularly among young adults, has implications for regulatory policy regarding the marketing and promotion of flavored products. These findings may provide direction for the Food and Drug Administration's plans to restrict flavors other than menthol, mint, and tobacco.","publicationTitle":"Addict.

However, there is limited evidence regarding individual-level correlates of meeting these recommendations in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In order to target policies and interventions aimed at improving intake, global monitoring of fruit and vegetable consumption by socio-demographic subpopulations is required. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to 1) assess the proportion of individuals meeting the WHO recommendation and 2) evaluate socio-demographic predictors (age, sex, and educational attainment) of meeting the WHO recommendation. METHODS: Data were collected from 193,606 individuals aged $\\geq$15 y in 28 LMICs between 2005 and 2016. The prevalence of meeting the WHO recommendation took into account the complex survey designs, and countries were weighted according to their World Bank population estimates in 2015. Poisson regression was used to estimate associations with socio-demographic characteristics. RESULTS: The proportion (95% CI) of individuals aged $\\geq$15 y who met the WHO recommendation was 18.0% (16.6-19.4%). Mean intake of fruits was 1.15 (1.10-1.20) servings per day and for vegetables, 2.46 (2.40-2.51) servings/d. The proportion of individuals meeting the recommendation increased with increasing country gross domestic product (GDP) class (P < 0.0001) and with decreasing country FAO food price index (FPI; indicating greater stability of food prices; P < 0.0001). At the individual level, those with secondary education or greater were more likely to achieve the recommendation compared with individuals with no formal education: risk ratio (95% CI), 1.61 (1.24-2.09). CONCLUSIONS: Over 80% of individuals aged $\\geq$15 y living in these 28 LMICs consumed lower amounts of fruits and vegetables than recommended by the WHO. Policies to promote fruit and vegetable consumption in LMICs are urgently needed to address the observed inequities in intake and prevent NCDs.","publicationTitle":"J.

Materials and methods Retrospective study using de-identified electronic health records linked to insurance claims data. Study included a prevalence-based sample of overweight or obese patients with antihyperglycaemic-treated T2D. Patients had $\\geq$1 A1c measurement in 2014 (last observed = index A1c), $\\geq$1 BMI measurement within $\\pm$90 days of index (average BMI = baseline BMI), and continuous enrolment for 180 days before (baseline) through 395 days after index (day 30-395 = follow-up).

Multivariable regressions were used to examine one-year follow-up T2D-HE as a function of BMI, insulin use, an interaction term between BMI and insulin use, and patient demographics. Results Study included 13 026 patients (mean age = 63.6 years; 48.1% female; 29.5% overweight, 31.6% OCI, 20.3% OCII, 18.6% OCIII; 25.3% insulin users). Baseline insulin use rates monotonically ranged from 19.7% in overweight patients to 33.0% in OCIII patients (P < 0.001). Together, BMI and insulin use were jointly associated with one-year follow-up T2D-HE, which monotonically ranged from $5842 in overweight patients with no insulin to $17 700 OCIII insulin users, P < 0.001. Within each BMI category, insulin users' one-year T2D-HE was at least double that of non-users. Additional analyses of all-cause healthcare expenditures yielded consistent results. Conclusions BMI and insulin use represent simple stratifiers for identifying high-cost patients. OCIII insulin users incurred the greatest annual healthcare expenditures; these patients may be an ideal group for targeted interventions.","publicationTitle":"Diabetes Obes.

We limited the sample to current cigarette smokers aged 25+ years who were not current e-cigarette users at wave 1. We modelled 30-day cigarette cessation and substantial reduction in cigarette consumption as a function of e-cigarette initiation between surveys using multivariable logistic regression.Results Between waves 1 and 2, 6.9% of cigarette smokers who were not current e-cigarette users transitioned to former smokers. After adjusting for covariates, cigarette smokers who initiated e-cigarette use between waves and reported they used e-cigarettes daily at wave 2 had 7.88 (95% CI 4.45 to 13.95) times the odds of 30-day cigarette cessation compared with non-users of e-cigarettes at wave 2.

Weight loss in patients with poor health, however, may in part explain this observation. This study evaluated the impact of weight early in life and weight loss on mortality in patients with RA. METHODS: Patients with RA (age >40 years) were active participants in a prospective clinical registry with up to 17 years of follow-up. Current and age-30 body mass index (BMI) were determined from self-report of height and weight from semi-annual questionnaires. Mortality was assessed from National Death Index. Risks of obesity reported from both early in life and at enrolment in the registry were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Among 12,679 participants (80% female), there were 1,520 deaths in 80,502 person-years. Obesity at enrolment (BMI >30 kg/m2) was modestly associated with greater mortality [HR: 1.34 (1.18,1.53) p=0.001]. Adjusting for disability and comorbidities hypothesised to be mediators in the causal pathway between obesity and mortality further attenuated this association [HR: 0.92 (0.80,1.06) p=0.24]. In contrast, obesity at age 30 was strongly associated with mortality [HR: 2.00 (1.65,2.42) p<0.001]. Additionally, weight loss since age-30 was a strong, dose-dependent predictor of mortality independent of enrolment BMI. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of obesity is substantially underestimated when epidemiologic methods do not account for long-term weight changes. Both obesity and weight loss are strongly associated with mortality risk in patients with RA.","publicationTitle":"Clin. Exp.

Hypertension, which leads to heart attacks and strokes, already affects one billion people worldwide, making it a global public health issue. Incidence and prevalence of the condition is on the rise in low- and middle-income countries, with the biggest increase in sub-Saharan Africa and South Africa at the forefront. We examined the prevalence, incidence, predictors, treatment, and control of hypertension among HIV-positive patients on ART in a large South African observational cohort. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of ART naïve adults initiating ART at a public sector HIV clinic in South Africa between April 2004-2017. Patients with diagnosed hypertension at ART initiation were excluded from the incidence analysis. Log-binomial regression was used to estimate predictors of hypertension at ART initiation, while competing risks regression was used to evaluate the relationship between predictors of incident hypertension, accounting for death as a competing risk. RESULTS: Among 77,696 eligible patients, 22.0% had prevalent hypertension at ART initiation. Of the remaining patients with no hypertension at ART initiation, 8,125 incident hypertension cases were diagnosed over the period of follow-up, corresponding to an incident rate of 5.4 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval (CI): 5.3-5.6). We found patients $\\geq$40 years of age and patients with a body mass index (BMI) $\\geq$25kg/m2 were at increased risk of both prevalent and incident hypertension. Male patients and those with pre-hypertension at ART initiation had increased hazards of hypertension over the period of follow-up. When assessing the choice of antiretroviral drug in first-line ART, patients initiated on nevirapine were at 27% increased risk of developing hypertension compared to those initiated on efavirenz, while patients who initiated on either zidovudine or stavudine had a 40% increased risk of developing hypertension compared to patients initiated on tenofovir. Patientswith poorer health status at ART initiation (i.e. WHO III/IV stage, low CD4 count, low hemoglobin levels and low BMI) had a decrease risk of prevalent hypertension. We found an inverse relationship in patients with a CD4 count <50 cells/mm3 at ART initiation who had a 25% increased risk of incident hypertension compared to those with a CD4 count $\\geq$350 cells/mm3. CONCLUSION: Over 20% of patients in our cohort had hypertension at ART initiation, and 13% of those with normal blood pressure at ART initiation developed hypertension while on ART. Older patients, males, those on nevirapine, zidovudine or stavudine, and those who are overweight/obese should be targeted for frequent blood pressure monitoring and the identification of other cardiovascular risk factors to encourage lifestyle modifications. Additionally, these groups should be offered pharmaceutical therapy to help prevent myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and kidney disease. Further research is needed to determine the level of access and adherence to pharmaceutical treatment for hypertension in this population. Additionally, an HIV-negative comparison population is needed to assess the association of the HIV virus itself with hypertension.","publicationTitle":"PLoS One","volume":"13","issue":"10","pages":"e0204020","date":"2018-10","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"Publisher: journals.plos.org","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:18Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:18Z"}},{"key":"NRQU5KQ6","version":12,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/NRQU5KQ6","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/NRQU5KQ6","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Mchiza et al.","parsedDate":"2018-01","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"NRQU5KQ6","version":12,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Understanding the determinants of hemoglobin and iron status: adolescent-adult women comparisons in SANHANES-1","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Zandile J","lastName":"Mchiza"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Whadi-Ah","lastName":"Parker"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Ronel","lastName":"Sewpaul"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Nophiwe","lastName":"Job"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Lumbwe","lastName":"Chola"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Chipo","lastName":"Mutyambizi"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Moses","lastName":"Sithole"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Stokes"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Demetre","lastName":"Labadarios"}],"abstractNote":"The study compared hemoglobin (Hb) and serum ferritin levels between adolescent and adult women with different body mass indices, dietary intake, and sociodemography.

Abnormal Hb ($\\leq$12 g/dL) and serum ferritin (<15 μg/mL) were based on the World Health Organization's criteria for nonpregnant women aged ⩾15 years. Data were analyzed using STATA version 11. Overall, anemia was detected in 740 (23.3%) participants. Of the individuals in the subsample (n = 1123, 15-35 years) who had serum ferritin measured, 6.0% presented with iron depletion (ID) and 10.8% presented with iron-deficiency anemia (IDA). The highest prevalences of anemia, ID, and IDA were in 15- to 18-year-olds (11.2%, 8.8%, and 20.2%, respectively). Black young adults (19-24 years) were up to 40 times more likely to present with ID compared with their non-black counterparts. While overweight adolescents were three times more likely to be anemic, overweight and obese young adults, as well as obese older adults (25-35 years), were less likely to be anemic compared with normal-weight women of all age groups. Overconsumption of dietary fat increased ID by up to 54- and 11-fold (adolescents and 25- to 35-year-olds, respectively). In South Africa, anemia is most prevalent in adolescents and black women. Anemia is also an indicator of overconsumption of dietary fat and a marker of socioeconomic disadvantage.","publicationTitle":"Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Studies have found substantial variability across countries in the negative impacts of orphanhood on child health and education. One hypothesis for this variability is the resilience of the extended family network in some countries to care for orphans—networks under increasing pressure by the sheer number of orphans in many settings. Using household survey data from 21 countries in Africa, this study examines trends in orphanhood and living arrangements, and the links between the two. The findings confirm that orphanhood is increasing, although not all countries are experiencing rapid rises. In many countries, there has been a shift toward grandparents taking an increased childcare responsibility—especially where orphan rates are growing rapidly. This suggests some merit to the claim that the extended network is narrowing, focusing on grandparents who are older, and may be less able than working-age adults financially to support orphans. However, there are also changes in childcare patterns in countries with stable orphan rates or low HIV prevalence. This suggests that future work on living arrangements should not exclude low HIV/AIDS prevalence countries, and explanations for changes should include a broader set of factors.","publicationTitle":"World Dev.","volume":"38","issue":"12","pages":"1727–1746","date":"2010-12","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"Publisher: Elsevier","tags":[{"tag":"HIV/AIDS"},{"tag":"child fostering"},{"tag":"household structure"},{"tag":"orphans"},{"tag":"sub-Saharan Africa"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:18Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:18Z"}},{"key":"TDD9F5BK","version":12,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/TDD9F5BK","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/TDD9F5BK","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Lim et al.","parsedDate":"2011-09","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"TDD9F5BK","version":12,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Net benefits: a multicountry analysis of observational data examining associations between insecticide-treated mosquito nets and health outcomes","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Stephen S","lastName":"Lim"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Nancy","lastName":"Fullman"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Stokes"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Nirmala","lastName":"Ravishankar"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Felix","lastName":"Masiye"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Christopher J L","lastName":"Murray"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Emmanuela","lastName":"Gakidou"}],"abstractNote":"BACKGROUND: Several sub-Saharan African countries have rapidly scaled up the number of households that own insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs). Although the efficacy of ITNs in trials has been shown, evidence on their impact under routine conditions is limited to a few countries and the extent to which the scale-up of ITNs has improved population health remains uncertain. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used matched logistic regression to assess the individual-level association between household ITN ownership or use in children under 5 years of age and the prevalence of parasitemia among children using six malaria indicator surveys (MIS) and one demographic and health survey. We used Cox proportional hazards models to assess the relationship between ITN household ownership and child mortality using 29 demographic and health surveys. The pooled relative reduction in parasitemia prevalence from random effects meta-analysis associated with household ownership of at least one ITN was 20% (95% confidence interval [CI] 3%-35%; I² = 73.5%, p0.05 for I² value). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings across a number of sub-Saharan African countries were highly consistent with results from previous clinical trials. These findings suggest that the recent scale-up in ITN coverage has likely been accompanied by significant reductions in child mortality and that additional health gains could be achieved with further increases in ITN coverage in populations at risk of malaria.

In addition to projections of current obesity, we project distributions of obesity when cohorts are age 25.

Estimates of the effects of smoking changes are based on observed relations between cohort smoking patterns and cohort death rates from lung cancer. We find that changes in both smoking and obesity are expected to have large effects on U.S. mortality. For males, the reductions in smoking have larger effects than the rise in obesity throughout the projection period. By 2040, male life expectancy at age 40 is expected to have gained 0.83 years from the combined effects. Among women, however, the two sets of effects largely offset one another throughout the projection period, with a small gain of 0.09 years expected by 2040.","publicationTitle":"Demography","volume":"51","issue":"1","pages":"27–49","date":"2014-02","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:18Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:18Z"}},{"key":"RW5UXI99","version":12,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/RW5UXI99","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/RW5UXI99","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Banack et al.","parsedDate":"2018-09","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"RW5UXI99","version":12,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Stratified Probabilistic Bias Analysis for Body Mass Index-related Exposure Misclassification in Postmenopausal Women","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Hailey R","lastName":"Banack"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Stokes"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Matthew P","lastName":"Fox"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Kathleen M","lastName":"Hovey"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Elizabeth M","lastName":"Cespedes Feliciano"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Erin S","lastName":"LeBlanc"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Chloe","lastName":"Bird"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Bette J","lastName":"Caan"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Candyce H","lastName":"Kroenke"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Matthew A","lastName":"Allison"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Scott B","lastName":"Going"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Linda","lastName":"Snetselaar"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Ting-Yuan David","lastName":"Cheng"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Rowan T","lastName":"Chlebowski"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Marcia L","lastName":"Stefanick"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Michael J","lastName":"LaMonte"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Wactawski-Wende"}],"abstractNote":"BACKGROUND: There is widespread concern about the use of body mass index (BMI) to define obesity status in postmenopausal women because it may not accurately represent an individual's true obesity status. The objective of the present study is to examine and adjust for exposure misclassification bias from using an indirect measure of obesity (BMI) compared with a direct measure of obesity (percent body fat). METHODS: We used data from postmenopausal non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic white women in the Women's Health Initiative (n=126,459). Within the Women's Health Initiative, a sample of 11,018 women were invited to participate in a sub-study involving dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scans. We examined indices of validity comparing BMI-defined obesity ($\\geq$30 kg/m), with obesity defined by percent body fat. We then used probabilistic bias analysis models stratified by age and race to explore the effect of exposure misclassification on the obesity-mortality relationship. RESULTS: Validation analyses highlight that using a BMI cutpoint of 30 kg/m to define obesity in postmenopausal women is associated with poor validity. There were notable differences in sensitivity by age and race. Results from the stratified bias analysis demonstrated that failing to adjust for exposure misclassification bias results in attenuated estimates of the obesity-mortality relationship. For example, in non-Hispanic white women 50-59 years of age, the conventional risk difference was 0.017 (95% confidence interval = 0.01, 0.023) and the bias-adjusted risk difference was 0.035 (95% simulation interval = 0.028, 0.043). CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the importance of using quantitative bias analysis techniques to account for nondifferential exposure misclassification of BMI-defined obesity.

Whether obesity is causally associated with improved mortality in these conditions is unresolved. METHODS: We develop the logic of collider bias as it pertains to the association between smoking and obesity in a diseased population. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) are used to investigate this bias empirically among persons with diabetes and prediabetes (dysglycemia). We also use NHANES to investigate whether reverse causal pathways are more prominent among people with dysglycemia than in the source population. Cox regression analysis is used to examine the extent of the obesity paradox among those with dysglycemia. In the regression analysis, we explore interactions between obesity and smoking, and we implement a variety of data restrictions designed to reduce the extent of reverse causality. RESULTS: We find an obesity paradox among persons with dysglycemia. In this population, the inverse association between obesity and smoking is much stronger than in the source population, and the extent of illness and weight loss is greater. The obesity paradox is absent among never-smokers. Among smokers, the paradox is eliminated through successive efforts to reduce the extent of reverse causality. CONCLUSION: Higher mortality among normal-weight people with dysglycemia is not causal but is rather a product of the closer inverse association between obesity and smoking in this subpopulation.","publicationTitle":"Epidemiology","volume":"25","issue":"3","pages":"454–461","date":"2014-05","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:18Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:18Z"}},{"key":"EQS34E32","version":11,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/EQS34E32","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/EQS34E32","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Preston et al.","parsedDate":"2018-12","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"EQS34E32","version":11,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Effect of Diabetes on Life Expectancy in the United States by Race and Ethnicity","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Samuel H","lastName":"Preston"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Daesung","lastName":"Choi"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Irma T","lastName":"Elo"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Stokes"}],"abstractNote":"We investigated the impact of diabetes on US life expectancy by sex and race/ethnicity using a prospective cohort study design.

We use national population-based survey data to quantify diabetes prevalence and met and unmet need for diabetes diagnosis and care in 12 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. We further estimate demographic and economic gradients of met need for diabetes diagnosis and care. METHODS: We did a pooled analysis of individual-level data from nationally representative population-based surveys that met the following inclusion criteria: the data were collected during 2005-15; the data were made available at the individual level; a biomarker for diabetes was available in the dataset; and the dataset included information on use of core health services for diabetes diagnosis and care. We first quantified the population in need of diabetes diagnosis and care by estimating the prevalence of diabetes across the surveys; we also quantified the prevalence of overweight and obesity, as a major risk factor for diabetes and an indicator of need for diabetes screening. Second, we determined the level of met need for diabetes diagnosis, preventive counselling, and treatment in both the diabetic and the overweight and obese population. Finally, we did survey fixed-effects regressions to establish the demographic and economic gradients of met need for diabetes diagnosis, counselling, and treatment. FINDINGS: We pooled data from 12 nationally representative population-based surveys in sub-Saharan Africa, representing 38 311 individuals with a biomarker measurement for diabetes. Across the surveys, the median prevalence of diabetes was 5% (range 2-14) and the median prevalence of overweight or obesity was 27% (range 16-68). We estimated seven measures of met need for diabetes-related care across the 12 surveys: (1) percentage of the overweight or obese population who received a blood glucose measurement (median 22% [IQR 11-37]); and percentage of the diabetic population who reported that they (2) had ever received a blood glucose measurement (median 36% [IQR 27-63]); (3) had ever been told that they had diabetes (median 27% [IQR 22-51]); (4) had ever been counselled to lose weight (median 15% [IQR 13-23]); (5) had ever been counselled to exercise (median 15% [IQR 11-30]); (6) were using oral diabetes drugs (median 25% [IQR 18-42]); and (7) were using insulin (median 11% [IQR 6-13]). Compared with those aged 15-39 years, the adjusted odds of met need for diabetes diagnosis (measures 1-3) were 2·22 to 3·53 (40-54 years) and 3·82 to 5·01 ($\\geq$55 years) times higher. The adjusted odds of met need for diabetes diagnosis also increased consistently with educational attainment and were between 3·07 and 4·56 higher for the group with 8 years or more of education than for the group with less than 1 year of education. Finally, need for diabetes care was significantly more likely to be met (measures 4-7) in the oldest age and highest educational groups. INTERPRETATION: Diabetes has already reached high levels of prevalence in several countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Large proportions of need for diabetes diagnosis and care in the region remain unmet, but the patterns of unmet need vary widely across the countries in our sample. Novel health policies and programmes are urgently needed to increase awareness of diabetes and to expand coverage of preventive counselling, diagnosis, and linkage to diabetes care. Because the probability of met need for diabetes diagnosis and care consistently increases with age and educational attainment, policy makers should pay particular attention to improved access to diabetes services for young adults and people with low educational attainment.

We evaluated associations between adiposity and mortality in younger and older participants before and after considering historical weight loss. METHODS: This study used whole-body dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in adults at least 20 years of age. Fat mass index (FMI), determined by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, was converted to age-, sex-, and race-specific Z-Scores. Percent change in weight from the maximum reported weight was determined and categorized. Cox proportional hazards models assessed associations between quintile of FMI Z-Score and mortality. Sequential models adjusted for percent weight change since the maximum weight. RESULTS: Participants with lower FMI were more likely to have lost weight from their maximum, particularly among older participants with lower FMI. Substantially greater risk of mortality was observed for the highest quintile of FMI Z-Score compared to the second quintile among younger individuals [HR 2.50 (1.69, 3.72) p < .001]. In contrast, a more modest association was observed among older individuals in the highest quintile [HR 1.23 (0.99, 1.52) p = .06] (p for interaction <.001). In both the younger and older participants, the risks of greater FMI Z-Score were magnified when adjusting for percent weight change since maximum reported weight. CONCLUSIONS: Older people with low fat mass report greater historical weight loss, potentially explaining substantially altered relationships between fat mass and mortality in older individuals. As a result, epidemiologic studies performed in older populations will likely underestimate the causal risks of excess adiposity.","publicationTitle":"J. Gerontol. A Biol. Sci. Med.

METHODS: Using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey data from 2016 to 2018, adult women of reproductive age (18-49 years) who reported being pregnant (n=7,434) were studied. Self-reported current e-cigarette use was the main exposure. Other measures included combustible cigarette smoking status and high-risk behaviors (including other tobacco, marijuana, or heavy alcohol use; binge drinking; and others). All analyses were done in 2019. RESULTS: Approximately 2.2% of pregnant women reported current e-cigarette use, of whom 0.6% reported daily use. The highest prevalence of e-cigarette use was observed in the youngest age group of pregnant women (3.2%), with 41.7% of all pregnant current e-cigarette users being aged 18-24 years. There was a marked increase in the prevalence of current use of e-cigarettes among pregnant women from 1.9% in 2016 to 3.8% in 2018. Approximately 46% of pregnant current e-cigarette users reported concomitant cigarette smoking. Compared with pregnant never e-cigarette users, pregnant current e-cigarette users had a higher prevalence of other tobacco product use, marijuana use, heavy alcohol intake, binge drinking, and other high-risk behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the need to strengthen prevention and policy efforts, specifically in the vulnerable subgroup of pregnant women.","publicationTitle":"Am. J. Prev.

The objective of this study was to investigate methodological explanations for the apparent attenuation of obesity-related risks in older adults. We used data from 68,132 participants in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) clinical trial for this analysis. All of the participants were postmenopausal women aged 50-79 years at baseline (1993-1998). To examine reverse causality and selective attrition, we compared rate ratios from inverse probability of treatment- and censoring-weighted Poisson marginal structural models with results from an unweighted adjusted Poisson regression model.

However, there are concerns about the validity of BMI as a measure of obesity in postmenopausal women. Unlike BMI, which is an indirect measure of obesity and does not distinguish lean from fat mass, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) provides a direct measure of body fat and is considered a gold standard of adiposity measurement. The goal of this study is to examine the validity of using BMI to identify obesity in postmenopausal women relative to total body fat percent measured by DXA scan. METHODS: Data from 1,329 postmenopausal women participating in the Buffalo OsteoPerio Study were used in this analysis. At baseline, women ranged in age from 53 to 85 years. Obesity was defined as BMI $\\geq$ 30 kg/m and body fat percent (BF%) greater than 35%, 38%, or 40%. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value to evaluate the validity of BMI-defined obesity relative BF%. We further explored the validity of BMI relative to BF% using graphical tools, such as scatterplots and receiver-operating characteristic curves. Youden's J index was used to determine the empirical optimal BMI cut-point for each level of BF% defined obesity. RESULTS: The sensitivity of BMI-defined obesity was 32.4% for 35% body fat, 44.6% for 38% body fat, and 55.2% for 40% body fat. Corresponding specificity values were 99.3%, 97.1%, and 94.6%, respectively. The empirical optimal BMI cut-point to define obesity is 24.9 kg/m for 35% BF, 26.49 kg/m for 38% BF, and 27.05 kg/m for 40% BF according to the Youden's index. CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrate that a BMI cut-point of 30 kg/m does not appear to be an appropriate indicator of true obesity status in postmenopausal women. Empirical estimates of the validity of BMI from this study may be used by other investigators to account for BMI-related misclassification in older women.","publicationTitle":"Menopause","volume":"25","issue":"3","pages":"307–313","date":"2018-03","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"Publisher: ncbi.nlm.nih.gov","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:17Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:17Z"}},{"key":"2EAM8WNS","version":11,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/2EAM8WNS","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/2EAM8WNS","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Stokes and Preston","parsedDate":"2015-12","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"2EAM8WNS","version":11,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Smoking and reverse causation create an obesity paradox in cardiovascular disease","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Stokes"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Samuel H","lastName":"Preston"}],"abstractNote":"OBJECTIVE: Many studies find that excess weight is associated with better survival among individuals with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Investigations were carried out to see whether this “obesity paradox” can be explained by biases. METHODS: The association between weight status and mortality in the US population ages 35 and above with CVD was investigated. Data were obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988-2010, linked to mortality records through 2011. To minimize biases resulting from illness-induced weight loss, a reference category consisting of individuals who have always maintained normal weight was used. Age-standardized mortality rates and Cox models were estimated, comparing overweight/obesity (body mass index (BMI) $\\geq$25.0 kg m(-2) ) to normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9 kg m(-2) ). RESULTS: The paradox was present among those with overweight/obesity at the time of survey (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.89; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78-1.01). However, when the reference category was limited to the always-normal-weight, the paradox disappeared (HR = 1.16; 95% CI 0.95-1.41). When analysis was additionally confined to never-smokers, mortality risks were significantly higher in the overweight/obesity group (HR = 1.51; 95% CI 1.07-2.15; P = 0.021). CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide support for the hypothesis that lower mortality among individuals with CVD and overweight/obesity is a product of biases involving reverse causation and confounding by smoking.","publicationTitle":"Obesity","volume":"23","issue":"12","pages":"2485–2490","date":"2015-12","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:17Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:17Z"}},{"key":"DVF4DTZN","version":11,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/DVF4DTZN","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/DVF4DTZN","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Brennan et al.","parsedDate":"2019-11","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"DVF4DTZN","version":11,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Growth curve modelling to determine distinct BMI trajectory groups in HIV-positive adults on antiretroviral therapy in South Africa","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Alana T","lastName":"Brennan"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Kaitlyn M","lastName":"Berry"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Sydney","lastName":"Rosen"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Stokes"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Nigel J","lastName":"Crowther"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jaya","lastName":"George"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Frederick","lastName":"Raal"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Naseem","lastName":"Cassim"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Ian","lastName":"Sanne"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Lawrence","lastName":"Long"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Matthew P","lastName":"Fox"}],"abstractNote":"OBJECTIVE: Obesity is a major long-term concern in HIV-positive patients due to the pathogenic link between obesity and noncommunicable chronic diseases (NCDs). We aim to characterize changes in BMI over time on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and investigate the association between weight gain and survival in South Africa. DESIGN AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study among HIV-positive adults on first-line ART between April 2004 and 2015 in Johannesburg, South Africa. We used latent-class growth modelling (adjusted for age, sex and CD4 cell count) to identify groups of individuals with similar patterns of change in BMI over time. RESULTS: Eleven thousand, two hundred and sixty-three patients were included. The best fit model involved two linear and two quadratic trajectories. Thirty-five percent of patients were categorized into group one (mean BMI at ART initiation, 20.4 kg/m; mean BMI after 8 years of follow-up, 20.9 kg/m), 38% into group two (24.5-26.2 kg/m), 21% into group three (29.5-32.6 kg/m) and 6% into group four (36.5-40.0 kg/m). Over the 8 years of follow-up, 6% of our cohort went down in BMI standard category, while 45% went up. The largest increase occurred in the first 12 months on ART. In years 2 through 8, we saw a more gradual increase in BMI. CONCLUSION: The largest gain in BMI in HIV patients occurred in the first year on ART. During follow-up, over 50% of our population changed BMI categories putting them at an increased risk for NCDs.

Beginning with a Medline search, we identify, classify, and evaluate the major approaches that have been used to study these dynamics. We identify four types of models: additive models, duration-of-obesity models, additive-weight-change models, and interactive models. We develop a framework that integrates the major approaches and shows that they are often nested in one another, a property that facilitates statistical comparisons. Our criteria for evaluating models are two-fold: the model's interpretability and its ability to account for observed variation in health outcomes. We apply two sets of nested models to data on adults age 50-74 years at baseline in two national probability samples drawn from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. One set of models treats obesity as a dichotomous variable and the other treats it as a continuous variable. In three of four applications, a fully interactive model does not add significant explanatory power to the simple additive model. In all four applications, little explanatory power is lost by simplifying the additive model to a duration model in which the coefficients of weight at different ages are set equal to one another. Other versions of a duration-of-obesity model also perform well, underscoring the importance of obesity at early adult ages for mortality at older ages.","publicationTitle":"Epidemiology","volume":"24","issue":"1","pages":"158–166","date":"2013-01","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:17Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:17Z"}},{"key":"5YTCQBGB","version":10,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/5YTCQBGB","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/5YTCQBGB","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Tencza et al.","parsedDate":"2014-07","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"5YTCQBGB","version":10,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Factors responsible for mortality variation in the United States: A latent variable analysis","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Tencza"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Stokes"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Samuel","lastName":"Preston"}],"abstractNote":"BACKGROUND: Factors including smoking, drinking, substance abuse, obesity, and health care have all been shown to affect health and longevity. The relative importance of each of these factors is disputed in the literature, and has been assessed through a number of methods. OBJECTIVE: This paper uses a novel approach to identify factors responsible for interstate mortality variation. It identifies factors through their imprint on mortality patterns and can therefore identify factors that are difficult or impossible to measure directly, such as sensitive health behaviors. METHODS: The analysis calculates age-standardized death rates by cause of death from 2000-2009 for white men and women separately. Only premature deaths between ages 20-64 are included. Latent variables responsible for mortality variation are then identified through a factor analysis conducted on a death-rate-by-state matrix. These unobserved latent variables are inferred from observed mortality data and interpreted based on their correlations with individual causes of death. RESULTS: Smoking and obesity, substance abuse, and rural/urban residence are the three factors that make the largest contributions to state-level mortality variation among males. The same factors are at work for women but are less vividly revealed. The identification of factors is supported by a review of epidemiologic studies and strengthened by correlations with observable behavioral variables. Results are not sensitive to the choice of factor-analytic method used. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of interstate variation in mortality among white working-age adults in the United States is associated with a combination of smoking and obesity, substance abuse and rural/urban residence.","publicationTitle":"Demogr.

This brief characterizes how high levels of Covid mortality at midlife ages (45-64) are deeply intertwined with continuing racial inequity in Covid-19 mortality. Methods: Mortality data from Minnesota in 2020-2022 were analyzed in June 2022. Death certificate data and published vaccination rates in Minnesota allow vaccination and mortality rates to be observed with greater age and temporal precision than national data. Results: Black, Hispanic, and Asian adults under age 65 were all more highly vaccinated than white populations of the same ages during most of Minnesota's substantial and sustained Delta surge and all of the subsequent Omicron surge. However, white mortality rates were lower than those of all other groups. These disparities were extreme; at midlife ages (ages 45-64), during the Omicron period, more highly-vaccinated populations had COVID-19 mortality that was 164% (Asian-American), 115% (Hispanic), or 208% (Black) of white Covid-19 mortality at these ages. In Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) populations as a whole, Covid-19 mortality at ages 55-64 was greater than white mortality at 10 years older. Conclusions: This discrepancy between vaccination and mortality patterning by race/ethnicity suggests that, if the current period is a “pandemic of the unvaccinated,” it also remains a “pandemic of the disadvantaged” in ways that can decouple from vaccination rates. This result implies an urgent need to center health equity in the development of Covid-19 policy measures.","publicationTitle":"medRxiv","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2022-06","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"Publisher: ncbi.nlm.nih.gov","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:17Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:17Z"}},{"key":"7CCFHGVE","version":10,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/7CCFHGVE","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/7CCFHGVE","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Stokes et al.","parsedDate":"2021-03","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"7CCFHGVE","version":10,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Assessing the Impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic on US Mortality: A County-Level Analysis","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew C","lastName":"Stokes"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Dielle J","lastName":"Lundberg"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Irma T","lastName":"Elo"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Katherine","lastName":"Hempstead"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jacob","lastName":"Bor"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Samuel H","lastName":"Preston"}],"abstractNote":"BACKGROUND: Covid-19 excess deaths refer to increases in mortality over what would normally have been expected in the absence of the Covid-19 pandemic. Several prior studies have calculated excess deaths in the United States but were limited to the national or state level, precluding an examination of area-level variation in excess mortality and excess deaths not assigned to Covid-19. In this study, we take advantage of county-level variation in Covid-19 mortality to estimate excess deaths associated with the pandemic and examine how the extent of excess mortality not assigned to Covid-19 varies across subsets of counties defined by sociodemographic and health characteristics. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this ecological, cross-sectional study, we made use of provisional National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) data on direct Covid-19 and all-cause mortality occurring in U.S. counties from January 1 to December 31, 2020 and reported before March 12, 2021. We used data with a ten week time lag between the final day that deaths occurred and the last day that deaths could be reported to improve the completeness of data. Our sample included 2,096 counties with 20 or more Covid-19 deaths. The total number of residents living in these counties was 319.1 million. On average, the counties were 18.7% Hispanic, 12.7% non-Hispanic Black and 59.6% non-Hispanic White. 15.9% of the population was older than 65 years. We first modeled the relationship between 2020 all-cause mortality and Covid-19 mortality across all counties and then produced fully stratified models to explore differences in this relationship among strata of sociodemographic and health factors. Overall, we found that for every 100 deaths assigned to Covid-19, 120 all-cause deaths occurred (95% CI, 116 to 124), implying that 17% (95% CI, 14% to 19%) of excess deaths were ascribed to causes of death other than Covid-19 itself. Our stratified models revealed that the percentage of excess deaths not assigned to Covid-19 was substantially higher among counties with lower median household incomes and less formal education, counties with poorer health and more diabetes, and counties in the South and West. Counties with more non-Hispanic Black residents, who were already at high risk of Covid-19 death based on direct counts, also reported higher percentages of excess deaths not assigned to Covid-19. Study limitations include the use of provisional data that may be incomplete and the lack of disaggregated data on county-level mortality by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and sociodemographic and health characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that direct Covid-19 death counts in the United States in 2020 substantially underestimated total excess mortality attributable to Covid-19. Racial and socioeconomic inequities in Covid-19 mortality also increased when excess deaths not assigned to Covid-19 were considered. Our results highlight the importance of considering health equity in the policy response to the pandemic.","publicationTitle":"medRxiv","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2021-03","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:17Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:17Z"}},{"key":"ZPLQD7DI","version":10,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/ZPLQD7DI","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/ZPLQD7DI","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Luck et al.","parsedDate":"2022-03","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"ZPLQD7DI","version":10,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The unequal burden of the Covid-19 pandemic: Capturing racial/ethnic disparities in US cause-specific mortality","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Anneliese N","lastName":"Luck"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Samuel H","lastName":"Preston"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Irma T","lastName":"Elo"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew C","lastName":"Stokes"}],"abstractNote":"Despite a growing body of literature focused on racial/ethnic disparities in Covid-19 mortality, few previous studies have examined the pandemic's impact on 2020 cause-specific mortality by race and ethnicity. This paper documents changes in mortality by underlying cause of death and race/ethnicity between 2019 and 2020. Using age-standardized death rates, we attribute changes for Black, Hispanic, and White populations to various underlying causes of death and show how these racial and ethnic patterns vary by age and sex. We find that although Covid-19 death rates in 2020 were highest in the Hispanic community, Black individuals faced the largest increase in all-cause mortality between 2019 and 2020. Exceptionally large increases in mortality from heart disease, diabetes, and external causes of death accounted for the adverse trend in all-cause mortality within the Black population. Within Black and White populations, percentage increases in all-cause mortality were similar for men and women, as well as for ages 25-64 and 65+. Among the Hispanic population, however, percentage increases in mortality were greatest for working-aged men. These findings reveal that the overall impact of the pandemic on racial/ethnic disparities in mortality was much larger than that captured by official Covid-19 death counts alone.","publicationTitle":"SSM Popul Health","volume":"17","issue":"","pages":"101012","date":"2022-03","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Covid-19"},{"tag":"Inequality"},{"tag":"Mortality"},{"tag":"Public health"},{"tag":"Race/ethnicity"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:17Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:17Z"}},{"key":"P6R2E8S4","version":10,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/P6R2E8S4","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/P6R2E8S4","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Vierboom et al.","parsedDate":"2018-11","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"P6R2E8S4","version":10,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Patterns of weight change associated with disease diagnosis in a national sample","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Yana C","lastName":"Vierboom"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Samuel H","lastName":"Preston"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Stokes"}],"abstractNote":"BACKGROUND: The incidence and/or diagnosis of a major disease may activate weight change. Patterns of weight change associated with diagnoses have not been systematically documented. METHODS: We use data on adults ages 30+ in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 1999-2014. Self-reported current weight and weight one year prior are used to estimate percent weight change in the last year. We use self-reported data on arthritis, diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease, liver conditions, and respiratory disease diagnoses to compare weight change among individuals never diagnosed with these conditions, individuals diagnosed 0-1 years ago, and individuals diagnosed 2+ years ago. Multinomial logistic regressions adjust for the presence of multiple conditions. RESULTS: 17.7% of the adult population experienced weight loss of 5.0% or more in the year prior to survey. Individuals diagnosed with any of the conditions were less likely to maintain their weight than those without a diagnosis. Arthritis, diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and liver conditions were associated with net weight loss, whereas respiratory diseases were associated with higher probabilities of both losing and gaining weight. Among those losing 10% or more, 56.7% had been diagnosed with one of the conditions. Cancer was associated with the highest probability of unintentional weight loss and diabetes with the highest probability of intentional weight loss. CONCLUSIONS: Disease-associated weight changes leave a distinct imprint on patterns of weight change in the population. Individuals losing at least 10% of their weight in the last year have likely been diagnosed with one of the six conditions.","publicationTitle":"PLoS One","volume":"13","issue":"11","pages":"e0207795","date":"2018-11","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:17Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:17Z"}},{"key":"XV6EK36H","version":10,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/XV6EK36H","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/XV6EK36H","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Geldsetzer et al.","parsedDate":"2019-08","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"XV6EK36H","version":10,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The state of hypertension care in 44 low-income and middle-income countries: a cross-sectional study of nationally representative individual-level data from 1·1 million adults","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Geldsetzer"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jennifer","lastName":"Manne-Goehler"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Maja-Emilia","lastName":"Marcus"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Cara","lastName":"Ebert"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Zhaxybay","lastName":"Zhumadilov"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Chea S","lastName":"Wesseh"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Lindiwe","lastName":"Tsabedze"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Adil","lastName":"Supiyev"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Lela","lastName":"Sturua"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Silver K","lastName":"Bahendeka"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Abla M","lastName":"Sibai"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Sarah","lastName":"Quesnel-Crooks"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Bolormaa","lastName":"Norov"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Kibachio J","lastName":"Mwangi"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Omar","lastName":"Mwalim"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Roy","lastName":"Wong-McClure"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Mary T","lastName":"Mayige"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Joao S","lastName":"Martins"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Nuno","lastName":"Lunet"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Demetre","lastName":"Labadarios"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Khem B","lastName":"Karki"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Gibson B","lastName":"Kagaruki"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jutta M A","lastName":"Jorgensen"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Nahla C","lastName":"Hwalla"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Dismand","lastName":"Houinato"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Corine","lastName":"Houehanou"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Msaidié"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"David","lastName":"Guwatudde"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Mongal S","lastName":"Gurung"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Gladwell","lastName":"Gathecha"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Maria","lastName":"Dorobantu"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Albertino","lastName":"Damasceno"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Bovet"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Brice W","lastName":"Bicaba"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Krishna K","lastName":"Aryal"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Glennis","lastName":"Andall-Brereton"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Kokou","lastName":"Agoudavi"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Stokes"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Justine I","lastName":"Davies"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Till","lastName":"Bärnighausen"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Rifat","lastName":"Atun"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Vollmer"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Lindsay M","lastName":"Jaacks"}],"abstractNote":"BACKGROUND: Evidence from nationally representative studies in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) on where in the hypertension care continuum patients are lost to care is sparse. This information, however, is essential for effective targeting of interventions by health services and monitoring progress in improving hypertension care. We aimed to determine the cascade of hypertension care in 44 LMICs-and its variation between countries and population groups-by dividing the progression in the care process, from need of care to successful treatment, into discrete stages and measuring the losses at each stage. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we pooled individual-level population-based data from 44 LMICs. We first searched for nationally representative datasets from the WHO Stepwise Approach to Surveillance (STEPS) from 2005 or later. If a STEPS dataset was not available for a LMIC (or we could not gain access to it), we conducted a systematic search for survey datasets; the inclusion criteria in these searches were that the survey was done in 2005 or later, was nationally representative for at least three 10-year age groups older than 15 years, included measured blood pressure data, and contained data on at least two hypertension care cascade steps. Hypertension was defined as a systolic blood pressure of at least 140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure of at least 90 mm Hg, or reported use of medication for hypertension. Among those with hypertension, we calculated the proportion of individuals who had ever had their blood pressure measured; had been diagnosed with hypertension; had been treated for hypertension; and had achieved control of their hypertension. We weighted countries proportionally to their population size when determining this hypertension care cascade at the global and regional level. We disaggregated the hypertension care cascade by age, sex, education, household wealth quintile, body-mass index, smoking status, country, and region. We used linear regression to predict, separately for each cascade step, a country's performance based on gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, allowing us to identify countries whose performance fell outside of the 95% prediction interval. FINDINGS: Our pooled dataset included 1 100 507 participants, of whom 192 441 (17·5%) had hypertension. Among those with hypertension, 73·6% of participants (95% CI 72·9-74·3) had ever had their blood pressure measured, 39·2% of participants (38·2-40·3) had been diagnosed with hypertension, 29·9% of participants (28·6-31·3) received treatment, and 10·3% of participants (9·6-11·0) achieved control of their hypertension. Countries in Latin America and the Caribbean generally achieved the best performance relative to their predicted performance based on GDP per capita, whereas countries in sub-Saharan Africa performed worst. Bangladesh, Brazil, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Kyrgyzstan, and Peru performed significantly better on all care cascade steps than predicted based on GDP per capita. Being a woman, older, more educated, wealthier, and not being a current smoker were all positively associated with attaining each of the four steps of the care cascade. INTERPRETATION: Our study provides important evidence for the design and targeting of health policies and service interventions for hypertension in LMICs. We show at what steps and for whom there are gaps in the hypertension care process in each of the 44 countries in our study. We also identified countries in each world region that perform better than expected from their economic development, which can direct policy makers to important policy lessons. Given the high disease burden caused by hypertension in LMICs, nationally representative hypertension care cascades, as constructed in this study, are an important measure of progress towards achieving universal health coverage.

Few studies have examined patterns of e-cigarette use in individuals with cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined e-cigarette use in adults aged 18 to 89 years with a history of CVD, using data from the 2014 National Health Interview Survey. We investigated associations between ever and current e-cigarette use and smoking with multivariable logistic regression. In a secondary analysis, we modeled the association between e-cigarette use and a quit attempt over the past year. Former smokers with CVD who quit smoking within the past year showed 1.85 (95% confidence interval, 1.03, 3.33) times the odds of having ever used e-cigarettes as compared with those who reported being “some days” current smokers. Current smokers who attempted to quit smoking within the past year showed significantly increased odds of ever having used e-cigarettes (odds ratio, 1.70; 95% confidence interval, 1.25, 2.30) and currently using e-cigarettes (odds ratio, 1.97; 95% confidence interval, 1.32, 2.95) as compared with smokers who had not attempted to quit over the past year. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with CVD who recently quit smoking or reported a recent quit attempt were significantly more likely to use e-cigarettes than current smokers and those who did not report a quit attempt. Our findings may indicate that this population is using e-cigarettes as an aid to smoking cessation. Characterizing emerging e-cigarette use behaviors in adults with CVD may help to inform outreach activities aimed at this high-risk population.","publicationTitle":"J. Am.

However, the association between e-cigarette use and cardiovascular disease remains virtually unknown. Therefore, we aimed to examine the association between e-cigarette use and cardiovascular disease among never and current combustible-cigarette smokers. METHODS: We pooled 2016 and 2017 data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a large, nationally representative, cross-sectional telephone survey. We included 449,092 participants with complete self-reported information on all key variables. The main exposure, e-cigarette use, was further divided into daily or occasional use, and stratified by combustible-cigarette use (never and current). Cardiovascular disease, the main outcome, was defined as a composite of self-reported coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, or stroke. RESULTS: Of 449,092 participants, there were 15,863 (3.5%) current e-cigarette users, 12,908 (2.9%) dual users of e-cigarettes + combustible cigarettes, and 44,852 (10.0%) with cardiovascular disease. We found no significant association between e-cigarette use and cardiovascular disease among never combustible-cigarette smokers. Compared with current combustible-cigarette smokers who never used e-cigarettes, dual use of e-cigarettes + combustible cigarettes was associated with 36% higher odds of cardiovascular disease (odds ratio 1.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-1.56); with consistent results in subgroup analyses of premature cardiovascular disease in women <65 years and men <55 years old. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest significantly higher odds of cardiovascular disease among dual users of e-cigarettes + combustible cigarettes compared with smoking alone.

Objective: To evaluate the associations of prior e-cigarette use and other tobacco product use with subsequent cigarette initiation within 2 years of follow-up. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this prospective cohort study, data from waves 1 through 3 of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study (2013-2016) were used to assess youths aged 12 to 15 years who had never used cigarettes, e-cigarettes, or other tobacco products at wave 1. This was a nationally representative study of the US population. Data analysis was conducted in 2018. Exposures: First noncigarette tobacco product used (none, e-cigarette, or other tobacco product) between wave 1 and wave 3. Main Outcomes and Measures: Ever cigarette use and current cigarette use at wave 3. Results: In the sample (N = 6123), respondents were 49.5% female; 54.1% non-Hispanic, white; and the mean (SD) age was 13.4 (1.2) years. Of these, 8.6% reported e-cigarettes as their first tobacco product, while 5.0% reported using another noncigarette product first; 3.3% reported using cigarettes first. Cigarette use at wave 3 was higher among prior e-cigarette users (20.5%) compared with youths with no prior tobacco use (3.8%). Prior e-cigarette use was associated with more than 4 times the odds of ever cigarette use (odds ratio, 4.09; 95% CI, 2.97-5.63) and nearly 3 times the odds of current cigarette use (odds ratio, 2.75; 95% CI, 1.60-4.73) compared with no prior tobacco use. Prior use of other tobacco products was similarly associated with subsequent ever cigarette use (OR, 3.84; 95% CI, 2.63-5.63) and current cigarette use (OR, 3.43; 95% CI, 1.88-6.26) compared with no prior tobacco use. The association of prior e-cigarette use with cigarette initiation was stronger among low-risk youths (OR, 8.57; 95% CI, 3.87-18.97), a pattern not seen for prior other product use. Over the 2 years between 2013 and 2014 and 2015 and 2016, 21.8% of new cigarette ever use (178 850 youths) and 15.3% of current cigarette use (43 446 youths) among US youths aged 12 to 15 years may be attributable to prior e-cigarette use. Conclusions and Relevance: This study's findings support the notion that e-cigarette use is associated with increased risk for cigarette initiation and use, particularly among low-risk youths. At the population level, the use of e-cigarettes may be a contributor to the initiation of cigarette smoking among youths.","publicationTitle":"JAMA Netw Open","volume":"2","issue":"2","pages":"e187794","date":"2019-02","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:16Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:16Z"}},{"key":"T43KH9UT","version":9,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/T43KH9UT","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/T43KH9UT","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Manne-Goehler et al.","parsedDate":"2019-03","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"T43KH9UT","version":9,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Health system performance for people with diabetes in 28 low- and middle-income countries: A cross-sectional study of nationally representative surveys","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jennifer","lastName":"Manne-Goehler"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Geldsetzer"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Kokou","lastName":"Agoudavi"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Glennis","lastName":"Andall-Brereton"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Krishna K","lastName":"Aryal"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Brice Wilfried","lastName":"Bicaba"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Bovet"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Garry","lastName":"Brian"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Maria","lastName":"Dorobantu"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Gladwell","lastName":"Gathecha"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Mongal","lastName":"Singh Gurung"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"David","lastName":"Guwatudde"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Msaidie"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Corine","lastName":"Houehanou"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Dismand","lastName":"Houinato"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jutta Mari Adelin","lastName":"Jorgensen"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Gibson B","lastName":"Kagaruki"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Khem B","lastName":"Karki"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Demetre","lastName":"Labadarios"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Joao S","lastName":"Martins"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Mary T","lastName":"Mayige"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Roy Wong","lastName":"McClure"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Omar","lastName":"Mwalim"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Joseph Kibachio","lastName":"Mwangi"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Bolormaa","lastName":"Norov"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Sarah","lastName":"Quesnel-Crooks"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Bahendeka K","lastName":"Silver"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Lela","lastName":"Sturua"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Lindiwe","lastName":"Tsabedze"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Chea Stanford","lastName":"Wesseh"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Stokes"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Maja","lastName":"Marcus"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Cara","lastName":"Ebert"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Justine I","lastName":"Davies"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Vollmer"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Rifat","lastName":"Atun"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Till W","lastName":"Bärnighausen"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Lindsay M","lastName":"Jaacks"}],"abstractNote":"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of diabetes is increasing rapidly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), urgently requiring detailed evidence to guide the response of health systems to this epidemic. In an effort to understand at what step in the diabetes care continuum individuals are lost to care, and how this varies between countries and population groups, this study examined health system performance for diabetes among adults in 28 LMICs using a cascade of care approach. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We pooled individual participant data from nationally representative surveys done between 2008 and 2016 in 28 LMICs. Diabetes was defined as fasting plasma glucose $\\geq$ 7.0 mmol/l (126 mg/dl), random plasma glucose $\\geq$ 11.1 mmol/l (200 mg/dl), HbA1c $\\geq$ 6.5%, or reporting to be taking medication for diabetes. Stages of the care cascade were as follows: tested, diagnosed, lifestyle advice and/or medication given (“treated”), and controlled (HbA1c < 8.0% or equivalent). We stratified cascades of care by country, geographic region, World Bank income group, and individual-level characteristics (age, sex, educational attainment, household wealth quintile, and body mass index [BMI]). We then used logistic regression models with country-level fixed effects to evaluate predictors of (1) testing, (2) treatment, and (3) control. The final sample included 847,413 adults in 28 LMICs (8 low income, 9 lower-middle income, 11 upper-middle income). Survey sample size ranged from 824 in Guyana to 750,451 in India. The prevalence of diabetes was 8.8% (95% CI: 8.2%-9.5%), and the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes was 4.8% (95% CI: 4.5%-5.2%). Health system performance for management of diabetes showed large losses to care at the stage of being tested, and low rates of diabetes control. Total unmet need for diabetes care (defined as the sum of those not tested, tested but undiagnosed, diagnosed but untreated, and treated but with diabetes not controlled) was 77.0% (95% CI: 74.9%-78.9%). Performance along the care cascade was significantly better in upper-middle income countries, but across all World Bank income groups, only half of participants with diabetes who were tested achieved diabetes control. Greater age, educational attainment, and BMI were associated with higher odds of being tested, being treated, and achieving control. The limitations of this study included the use of a single glucose measurement to assess diabetes, differences in the approach to wealth measurement across surveys, and variation in the date of the surveys. CONCLUSIONS: The study uncovered poor management of diabetes along the care cascade, indicating large unmet need for diabetes care across 28 LMICs. Performance across the care cascade varied by World Bank income group and individual-level characteristics, particularly age, educational attainment, and BMI. This policy-relevant analysis can inform country-specific interventions and offers a baseline by which future progress can be measured.","publicationTitle":"PLoS Med.","volume":"16","issue":"3","pages":"e1002751","date":"2019-03","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","extra":"Publisher: Public Library of Science (PLoS)","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:16Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:16Z"}},{"key":"L4GNZKZF","version":9,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/L4GNZKZF","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/L4GNZKZF","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Stokes et al.","parsedDate":"2021-02","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"L4GNZKZF","version":9,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Association of Cigarette and Electronic Cigarette Use Patterns With Levels of Inflammatory and Oxidative Stress Biomarkers Among US Adults: Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew C","lastName":"Stokes"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Wubin","lastName":"Xie"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Anna E","lastName":"Wilson"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Hanqi","lastName":"Yang"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Olusola A","lastName":"Orimoloye"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Alyssa F","lastName":"Harlow"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jessica L","lastName":"Fetterman"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew P","lastName":"DeFilippis"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Emelia J","lastName":"Benjamin"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Rose Marie","lastName":"Robertson"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Aruni","lastName":"Bhatnagar"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Naomi M","lastName":"Hamburg"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Michael J","lastName":"Blaha"}],"abstractNote":"","publicationTitle":"Circulation","volume":"143","issue":"8","pages":"869–871","date":"2021-02","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"electronic nicotine delivery systems"},{"tag":"inflammation"},{"tag":"oxidative stress"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:16Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:16Z"}},{"key":"G6RMMM27","version":9,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/G6RMMM27","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/G6RMMM27","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Fetterman et al.","parsedDate":"2020-05","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"G6RMMM27","version":9,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Alterations in Vascular Function Associated With the Use of Combustible and Electronic Cigarettes","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jessica L","lastName":"Fetterman"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Rachel J","lastName":"Keith"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Joseph N","lastName":"Palmisano"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Kathleen L","lastName":"McGlasson"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Robert M","lastName":"Weisbrod"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Sana","lastName":"Majid"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Reena","lastName":"Bastin"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Mary Margaret","lastName":"Stathos"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew C","lastName":"Stokes"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Rose Marie","lastName":"Robertson"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Aruni","lastName":"Bhatnagar"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Naomi M","lastName":"Hamburg"}],"abstractNote":"Background Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have been proposed as a potential harm reduction tool for combustible cigarette smokers. The majority of adult e-cigarette users continue to smoke combustible cigarettes and are considered dual users. The vascular impact of e-cigarettes remains incompletely defined. Methods and Results We examined the association of e-cigarette use with measures of vascular function and tonometry, preclinical measures of cardiovascular injury. As part of the CITU (Cardiovascular Injury due to Tobacco Use) study, we performed noninvasive vascular function testing in individuals without known cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular disease risk factors who were nonsmokers (n=94), users of combustible cigarettes (n=285), users of e-cigarettes (n=36), or dual users (n=52). In unadjusted analyses, measures of arterial stiffness including carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, augmentation index, carotid-radial pulse wave velocity, and central blood pressures differed across the use groups. In multivariable models adjusted for age, sex, race, and study site, combustible cigarette smokers had higher augmentation index compared with nonusers (129.8$\\pm$1.5 versus 118.8$\\pm$2.7, P=0.003). The augmentation index was similar between combustible cigarette smokers compared with sole e-cigarette users (129.8$\\pm$1.5 versus 126.2$\\pm$5.9, P=1.0) and dual users (129.8$\\pm$1.5 versus 134.9$\\pm$4.0, P=1.0). Endothelial cells from combustible cigarette smokers and sole e-cigarette users produced less nitric oxide in response to A23187 stimulation compared with nonsmokers, suggestive of impaired endothelial nitric oxide synthase signaling. Conclusions Our findings suggest that e-cigarette use is not associated with a more favorable vascular profile. Future longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate the long-term risks of sustained e-cigarette use.","publicationTitle":"J. Am.

The aim of this study was to assess whether weight loss might explain these seemingly paradoxical observations. METHODS: Our study included patients identified from the Veterans Affairs (VA) RA Registry. Dates of death were abstracted from VA electronic medical records. The BMI at each study visit and the change from the previous visit were determined. The maximum BMI of each patient was also obtained from medical records. The annualized rate of BMI loss was determined from the slope of change (per year) in BMI over visits within the preceding 13 months. Cox multivariable proportional hazards models were used to assess associations between BMI measures and mortality. RESULTS: In a sample of 1,674 patients, 312 deaths occurred over 9,183 person-years. A loss in BMI of $\\geq$1 kg/m(2) was associated with a greater risk of death, after adjustment for demographics, comorbidities, BMI, smoking, and RA therapies (hazard ratio [HR] 1.99, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.53-2.59, P 30 kg/m(2) ) was associated with the greatest risk (HR 8.52, 95% CI 4.10-17.71, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Weight loss is a strong predictor of death in patients with RA. These observations may explain the observed obesity paradox and do not support a biologically protective role of obesity.","publicationTitle":"Arthritis Rheumatol","volume":"67","issue":"7","pages":"1711–1717","date":"2015-07","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:16Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:16Z"}},{"key":"TQHMH45A","version":9,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/TQHMH45A","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/TQHMH45A","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Preston et al.","parsedDate":"2015-12","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"TQHMH45A","version":9,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Effects of categorization and self-report bias on estimates of the association between obesity and mortality","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Samuel H","lastName":"Preston"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Ezra","lastName":"Fishman"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Stokes"}],"abstractNote":"PURPOSE: The health consequences of obesity are often assessed using categorical, self-reported data on body mass index (BMI). This article investigates the combined effects of categorization and self-report bias on the estimated association between obesity and mortality. METHODS: We used the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988-2008) linked to death records through 2011. Cox models and age-standardized death rates were used to evaluate the effects of categorization and self-report bias on the mortality risks and percent of deaths attributable to obesity. RESULTS: Despite a correlation between measured and self-reported BMI of 0.96, self-reports miscategorized 20% of adults. Hazard ratios using self-reports were overstated for the obese 1 (BMI, 30-35 kg/m(2)) and obese 2 (BMI $\\geq$ 35 kg/m(2)) categories. The bias was much smaller using a continuous measure of BMI. In contrast, the percent of deaths attributable to excess weight was lower using self-reported versus measured data because self-reports led to systematic downward bias in the BMI distribution. CONCLUSIONS: Categorization of BMI and self-report bias combine to produce substantial error in the estimated hazard ratios and percent of deaths attributable to obesity. Future studies should use caution when estimating the association between obesity and mortality using categorical self-reported data.","publicationTitle":"Ann.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between maximum BMI over 16 years and subsequent mortality. DESIGN: 3 prospective cohort studies. SETTING: Nurses' Health Study I and II and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study. PARTICIPANTS: 225 072 men and women with 32 571 deaths observed over a mean of 12.3 years of follow-up. MEASUREMENTS: Maximum BMI over 16 years of weight history and all-cause and cause-specific mortality. RESULTS: Maximum BMIs in the overweight (25.0 to 29.9 kg/m2) (multivariate hazard ratio [HR], 1.06 [95% CI, 1.03 to 1.08]), obese I (30.0 to 34.9 kg/m2) (HR, 1.24 [CI, 1.20 to 1.29]), and obese II ($\\geq$35.0 kg/m2) (HR, 1.73 [CI, 1.66 to 1.80]) categories were associated with increases in risk for all-cause death. The pattern of excess risk with a maximum BMI above normal weight was maintained across strata defined by smoking status, sex, and age, but the excess was greatest among those younger than 70 years and never-smokers. In contrast, a significant inverse association between overweight and mortality (HR, 0.96 [CI, 0.94 to 0.99]) was observed when BMI was defined using a single baseline measurement. Maximum overweight was also associated with increased cause-specific mortality, including death from cardiovascular disease and coronary heart disease. LIMITATION: Residual confounding and misclassification. CONCLUSION: The paradoxical association between overweight and mortality is reversed in analyses incorporating weight history. Maximum BMI may be a useful metric to minimize reverse causation bias associated with a single baseline BMI assessment.

In this study, we investigate the validity of a summary measure of weight history. METHODS: We evaluated the quality of reporting of maximum weight in a sample of adults aged 50-84 years using data from the Health and Retirement Study. Recalled max body mass index (BMI, measured in kilogram per square meter) based on recalled weight in 2004 was compared with calculated max BMI based on self-reported weight collected biennially between 1992 and 2004. Logistic regression was used to assess similarity between the measures in predicting prevalent conditions. RESULTS: The correlation coefficient between recalled and calculated max weight in the overall sample was 0.95. Recalled max BMI value was within three BMI units of the calculated value 91.4% of the time. The proportions of individuals with obese I (BMI: 30.0-34.9), obese II (BMI: 35.0-39.9), and obese III (BMI: 40.0 and above) were 28.8%, 12.7%, and 6.6% using recalled values compared with 27.1%, 10.5%, and 4.9% using calculated values. In multivariate analyses, the two BMI measures similarly predicted disease prevalence across a number of chronic conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Recalled max BMI was strongly correlated with max BMI calculated over the 12-year period before recall, suggesting that this measure can serve as a reliable summary measure of recent weight status.","publicationTitle":"Ann.

However, prior analyses reveal that a significant percentage of excess deaths associated with the pandemic were not directly assigned to COVID-19. In this study, we estimated a generalized linear model of expected mortality based on historical trends in deaths by county of residence between 2011 and 2019. We used the results of the model to generate estimates of excess mortality and excess deaths not assigned to COVID-19 in 2020 for 1470 county sets in the U.S. representing 3138 counties. Across the country, we estimated that 438,386 excess deaths occurred in 2020, among which 87.5% were assigned to COVID-19. Some regions (Mideast, Great Lakes, New England, and Far West) reported the most excess deaths in large central metros, whereas other regions (Southwest, Southeast, Plains, and Rocky Mountains) reported the highest excess mortality in nonmetro areas. The proportion assigned to COVID-19 was lowest in large central metro areas (79.3%). Regionally, the proportion of excess deaths assigned to COVID-19 was lowest in the Southeast (81.6%), Southwest (82.6%), Far West (83.7%), and Rocky Mountains (86.7%). Across the regions, the number of excess deaths exceeded the number of directly assigned COVID-19 deaths in most counties. The exception to this pattern occurred in New England, which reported more directly assigned COVID-19 deaths than excess deaths in metro and nonmetro areas. Many county sets had substantial numbers of excess deaths that were not accounted for in direct COVID-19 death counts. Estimates of excess mortality at the local level can inform the allocation of resources to areas most impacted by the pandemic and contribute to positive behavior feedback loops, such as increases in mask-wearing and vaccine uptake.","publicationTitle":"SSM Popul Health","volume":"17","issue":"","pages":"101021","date":"2022-03","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"COVID-19"},{"tag":"Counties"},{"tag":"Excess deaths"},{"tag":"Geographic inequalities"},{"tag":"Mortality"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:16Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:16Z"}},{"key":"D67G3GMV","version":9,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/D67G3GMV","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/D67G3GMV","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Stokes","parsedDate":"2014-03","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"D67G3GMV","version":9,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Using maximum weight to redefine body mass index categories in studies of the mortality risks of obesity","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Stokes"}],"abstractNote":"BACKGROUND: The high prevalence of disease and associated weight loss at older ages limits the validity of prospective cohort studies examining the association between body mass index (BMI) and mortality. METHODS: I examined mortality associated with excess weight using maximum BMI-a measure that is robust to confounding by illness-induced weight loss. Analyses were carried out on US never-smoking adults ages 50-84 using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (1988-1994 and 1999-2004) linked to the National Death Index through 2006. Cox models were used to estimate hazard ratios for mortality according to BMI at time of survey and at maximum. RESULTS: Using maximum BMI, hazard ratios for overweight (BMI, 25.0-29.9 kg/m2), obese class 1 (BMI, 30.0-34.9 kg/m2) and obese class 2 (BMI, 35.0 kg/m2 and above) relative to normal weight (BMI, 18.5-24.9 kg/m2) were 1.28 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.89-1.84), 1.67 (95% CI, 1.15-2.40), and 2.15 (95% CI, 1.47-3.14), respectively. The corresponding hazard ratios using BMI at time of survey were 0.98 (95% CI, 0.77-1.24), 1.18 (95% CI, 0.91-1.54), and 1.31 (95% CI, 0.95-1.81). The percentage of mortality attributable to overweight and obesity among never-smoking adults ages 50-84 was 33% when assessed using maximum BMI. The comparable figure obtained using BMI at time of survey was substantially smaller at 5%. The discrepancy in estimates is explained by the fact that when using BMI at time of survey, the normal category combines low-risk stable-weight individuals with high-risk individuals that have experienced weight loss. In contrast, only the low-risk stable-weight group is categorized as normal weight using maximum BMI. CONCLUSIONS: Use of maximum BMI reveals that estimates based on BMI at the time of survey may substantially underestimate the mortality burden associated with excess weight in the US.","publicationTitle":"Popul.

As a consequence, there is generally no distinction made between nonobese individuals who were never obese and nonobese individuals who were formerly obese and lost weight. We introduce additional data on an individual's maximum attained weight and investigate four models that represent different combinations of weight at survey and maximum weight. We use data from the 1988-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, linked to death records through 2011, to estimate parameters of these models. We find that the most successful models use data on maximum weight, and the worst-performing model uses only data on weight at survey. We show that the disparity in predictive power between these models is related to exceptionally high mortality among those who have lost weight, with the normal-weight category being particularly susceptible to distortions arising from weight loss. These distortions make overweight and obesity appear less harmful by obscuring the benefits of remaining never obese. Because most previous studies are based on body mass index at survey, it is likely that the effects of excess weight on US mortality have been consistently underestimated.","publicationTitle":"Proc.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We estimated population attributable fractions (PAF) for cohorts aged 30-84 who were surveyed in the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) between 1997 and 2009 (N = 282,322) and in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 1999 and 2010 (N = 21,814). Cohort members were followed prospectively for mortality through 2011. We identified diabetes status using self-reported diagnoses in both NHIS and NHANES and using HbA1c in NHANES. Hazard ratios associated with diabetes were estimated using Cox model adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, and smoking status. RESULTS: We found a high degree of consistency between data sets and definitions of diabetes in the hazard ratios, estimates of diabetes prevalence, and estimates of the proportion of deaths attributable to diabetes. The proportion of deaths attributable to diabetes was estimated to be 11.5% using self-reports in NHIS, 11.7% using self-reports in NHANES, and 11.8% using HbA1c in NHANES. Among the sub-groups that we examined, the PAF was highest among obese persons at 19.4%. The proportion of deaths in which diabetes was assigned as the underlying cause of death (3.3-3.7%) severely understated the contribution of diabetes to mortality in the United States. CONCLUSION: Diabetes may represent a more prominent factor in American mortality than is commonly appreciated, reinforcing the need for robust population-level interventions aimed at diabetes prevention and care.","publicationTitle":"PLoS One","volume":"12","issue":"1","pages":"e0170219","date":"2017-01","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:16Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:16Z"}},{"key":"E39YQZHC","version":8,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/E39YQZHC","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/E39YQZHC","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Stokes and Preston","parsedDate":"2016-02","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"E39YQZHC","version":8,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"How smoking affects the proportion of deaths attributable to obesity: assessing the role of relative risks and weight distributions","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Stokes"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Samuel H","lastName":"Preston"}],"abstractNote":"OBJECTIVE: Although ever-smokers make up the majority of the older adult population in the USA, they are often excluded from studies examining the impact of obesity on mortality. Understanding how smoking and obesity interact is critical to assessing the proportion of deaths attributable to obesity. SETTING: Nationally representative sample of the non-institutionalised population of the USA. Baseline data were drawn from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988-1994 and 1999-2004. PARTICIPANTS: US adults aged 50-74 (n=9835). PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: We used Cox models to estimate the mortality risks of obesity by smoking status. All-cause mortality was assessed prospectively through 31 December 2006 (n=1243 deaths). Maximum body mass index (BMI) was specified as the key exposure variable. We also calculated population attributable fractions (PAFs) by smoking status and investigated differences in PAFs in a decomposition analysis. RESULTS: The HR associated with a one-unit increment in BMI beyond 25.0 kg/m(2) was 1.057 for never-smokers (95% CI 1.033 to 1.082; p<0.001), 1.036 for former smokers (95% CI 1.015 to 1.059; p<0.01) and 1.024 for current smokers (95% CI 0.997 to 1.052).We estimated that 19.8% of deaths were attributable to excess weight. The PAFs were 31.9, 20.4 and 11.3 for never-smokers, former and current smokers, respectively. The difference in PAFs between never-smokers and current smokers was almost entirely explained by the difference in HRs. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of deaths attributable to obesity is nearly 3 times as high among never-smokers compared with current smokers. This finding is consistent with the fact that smokers are subject to significant competing risks. Analyses that exclude smokers are likely to substantially overestimate the proportion of deaths attributable to obesity in the USA.","publicationTitle":"BMJ Open","volume":"6","issue":"2","pages":"e009232","date":"2016-02","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"EPIDEMIOLOGY"},{"tag":"PUBLIC HEALTH"},{"tag":"STATISTICS & RESEARCH METHODS"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:16Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:16Z"}},{"key":"SMLNCZFE","version":8,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/SMLNCZFE","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/SMLNCZFE","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Stokes and Preston","parsedDate":"2017-08","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"SMLNCZFE","version":8,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The contribution of rising adiposity to the increasing prevalence of diabetes in the United States","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Stokes"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Samuel H","lastName":"Preston"}],"abstractNote":"OBJECTIVE: We assessed the contribution of increasing adiposity to the rising prevalence of diabetes in the United States over the period 1988-2014.

At a second stage, we introduced measures of general and abdominal adiposity into the model. Changes in coefficients pertaining to period of observation between the first and second models were interpreted as indicating the extent to which adiposity can account for trends in the prevalence of diabetes. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to investigate how alternative definitions of adiposity and diabetes status would affect results.

Using data from the South African National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2011-2012), this analysis evaluates the national prevalence of hypertension and uses a care cascade to examine unmet need for care. METHODS: Hypertension was defined as blood pressure over 140/90 mm Hg or use of antihypertensive medication. We constructed a hypertension care cascade by decomposing the population with hypertension into five mutually exclusive and exhaustive subcategories: (1) unscreened and undiagnosed, (2) screened but undiagnosed, (3) diagnosed but untreated, (4) treated but uncontrolled and (5) treated and controlled. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to explore factors associated with hypertension prevalence and diagnosis. RESULTS: In South Africans aged 15 and above, the age standardised prevalence of hypertension was 35.1%. Among those with hypertension, 48.7% were unscreened and undiagnosed, 23.1% were screened but undiagnosed, 5.8% were diagnosed but untreated, 13.5% were treated but uncontrolled and 8.9% were controlled. The hypertension care cascade demonstrates that 49% of those with hypertension were lost at the screening stage, 50% of those who were screened never received a diagnosis, 23% of those who were diagnosed did not receive treatment and 48% of those who were treated did not reach the threshold for control. Men and older individuals had increased risks of being undiagnosed after controlling for other factors. CONCLUSIONS: There is significant unmet need for hypertension care in South Africa; 91.1% of the hypertensive population was unscreened, undiagnosed, untreated or uncontrolled. Data from this study provide insight into where patients are lost in the hypertension care continuum and serve as a benchmark for evaluating efforts to manage the rising burden of hypertension in South Africa.","publicationTitle":"BMJ Glob Health","volume":"2","issue":"3","pages":"e000348","date":"2017-08","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"South Africa"},{"tag":"blood pressure"},{"tag":"care continuum"},{"tag":"cascade of care"},{"tag":"health disparities"},{"tag":"hypertension"},{"tag":"non-communicable diseases"},{"tag":"sanhanes"},{"tag":"south african national health and nutrition examination survey"},{"tag":"treatment cascade"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:16Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:16Z"}},{"key":"YJYGEKQG","version":8,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/YJYGEKQG","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/YJYGEKQG","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Stokes et al.","parsedDate":"2018-05","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"YJYGEKQG","version":8,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Prevalence and Determinants of Engagement with Obesity Care in the United States","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Stokes"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jason M","lastName":"Collins"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Bethany F","lastName":"Grant"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Chia-Wen","lastName":"Hsiao"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Stephen S","lastName":"Johnston"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Eric M","lastName":"Ammann"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Kaitlyn M","lastName":"Berry"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Cindy","lastName":"Tong"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Robin F","lastName":"Scamuffa"}],"abstractNote":"OBJECTIVE: Medical management of obesity can result in significant weight loss and reduce the burden of obesity-related complications.

The pace of improvement is also slow by international standards. This paper attempts to identify the extent to which rising body mass index (BMI) is responsible for reductions in the rate of mortality improvement in the United States. The data for this study were obtained from subsequent cohorts of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III, 1988-1994; NHANES continuous, 1999-2010) and from the NHANES linked mortality files, which include follow-up into death records through December 2011. The role of BMI was estimated using Cox models comparing mortality trends in the presence and absence of adjustment for maximum lifetime BMI (Max BMI). Introducing Max BMI into a Cox model controlling for age and sex raised the annual rate of mortality decline by 0.54% (95% confidence interval 0.45-0.64%). Results were robust to the inclusion of other variables in the model, to differences in how Max BMI was measured, and to how trends were evaluated. The effect of rising Max BMI is large relative to international mortality trends and to alternative mortality futures simulated by the Social Security Administration. The increase in Max BMI over the period 1988-2011 is estimated to have reduced life expectancy at age 40 by 0.9 years in 2011 (95% confidence interval 0.7-1.1 years) and accounted for 186,000 excess deaths that year. Rising levels of BMI have prevented the United States from enjoying the full benefits of factors working to improve mortality.","publicationTitle":"Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), we investigated the association between self-reported weight change from young adulthood to midlife and incident diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We categorized individuals into four weight-change groups: those who remained nonobese (stable nonobese), those who moved from an obese BMI to a nonobese BMI (losing), those who moved from a nonobese BMI to an obese BMI (gaining), and those who remained obese (stable obese). Diabetes status was determined by self-report of a prior diagnosis, and age at diagnosis was used to establish time of diabetes onset. Hazard ratios (HRs) relating weight change to incident diabetes over 10 years of follow-up were calculated using Cox models adjusting for covariates. RESULTS: Those who were obese and lost weight exhibited a significantly lower risk (HR 0.33; 95% CI 0.14, 0.76) of diabetes compared with those with stable obesity. We also observed lower risk among those who were stable nonobese (HR 0.22; 95% CI 0.18, 0.28) and those in the gaining category (HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.57, 0.87). Further, there was evidence of an increased incidence of diabetes among obese individuals who lost weight compared with individuals who were stable nonobese; however, weight loss was rare, and the association was not statistically significant. If those who were obese had become nonobese during the 10-year period, we estimate that 9.1% (95% CI 5.3, 12.8) of observed diabetes cases could have been averted, and if the population had maintained a normal BMI during the period, 64.2% (95% CI 59.4, 68.3) of cases could have been averted. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study underscore the importance of population-level approaches to the prevention and treatment of obesity across the life course of individuals.","publicationTitle":"Diabetes Care","volume":"41","issue":"5","pages":"1025–1031","date":"2018-05","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:15Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:15Z"}},{"key":"49HZQ2QG","version":8,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/49HZQ2QG","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/49HZQ2QG","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Pestine et al.","parsedDate":"2018-07","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"49HZQ2QG","version":8,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Representation of obese participants in obesity-related cancer randomized trials","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"E","lastName":"Pestine"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"A","lastName":"Stokes"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"L","lastName":"Trinquart"}],"abstractNote":"Background: Obesity is a risk factor for numerous cancer types, and may influence cancer treatment outcomes. Underrepresentation of obese patients in obesity-related cancer randomized controlled trials (RCTs) may affect generalizability of results. We aimed to assess the reporting of information about eligibility and enrollment of obese participants in obesity-related cancer RCTs. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of RCTs of 10 obesity-related cancer types (esophagus, colon/rectum, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, postmenopausal breast, endometrium, ovary, kidney, and thyroid cancer). We selected RCTs published between 2013 and 2016 in five major journals. For each trial, we examined the article, the protocol, and the registration record. We assessed if eligibility criteria limiting the enrollment of obese participants were reported, the proportion of obese participants that were enrolled, and if a subgroup analysis according to obesity status was reported. We systematically contacted corresponding authors and asked for information about eligibility of obese participants and the proportion of obese participants. Results: We included 76 RCTs. Colon/rectum (n = 20), postmenopausal breast (n = 11), and kidney (n = 11) cancers were the most frequent types. Based on publicly available sources, information on the eligibility of obese participants was available in 5 (7%) trials. The proportion of obese participants could be estimated in 9 (12%) trials only. We found a subgroup analysis in only one RCT. When considering unpublished information, the eligibility of obese participants was explicitly stated in 31 (41%) trials but it was unclear if the remaining 59% trials considered obese participants as eligible and what proportion of obese participants was included. Across 22 trials, the median proportion of obese participants included was 18% (Q1-Q3 11-23). Conclusion: Information on the eligibility and enrollment of obese participants in cancer RCTs is dramatically underreported. More transparency is needed to understand the applicability of obesity-related cancer RCT results to obese patients with cancer.","publicationTitle":"Ann.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Using tobacco information from NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) 2013-2014, 5423 adults and 895 adolescents (aged 13-17 years) were included in this analysis. Demographic, tobacco use, and drug use information were self-reported. Recent e-cigarette use (within the previous 5 days) was stratified by smoking status. Of 125 e-cigarette users, 116 participants were aged $\\geq$18 years, corresponding to 2.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0-3.1) and 1.21% (95% CI, 0.3-2.1) prevalence of e-cigarette use among US adults and adolescents, respectively. E-cigarette adult users were current smokers (68.1%), former smokers (23.7%), and never smokers (8.2%). The highest prevalence of e-cigarette use was among current smokers (8.2%; 95% CI, 6.3-10.1), followed by former smokers (2.7%; 95% CI, 1.4-4.1), and then never smokers (0.4%; 95% CI, 0.2-0.6).

CONCLUSIONS: Between 2013 and 2014, e-cigarette use in the United States was more common among younger people, those with low socioeconomic status, and current and former smokers. These findings will help inform future research as well as public policy and regulatory actions.","publicationTitle":"J. Am.

Objective: To investigate the association between maximum body mass index (BMI) and all-cause mortality without the consequences of reverse causality. Design, Setting, and Participants: Prospective cohort studies for the original and offspring cohorts of the Framingham Heart Study. The follow-up period started from baseline examination 13 for the original cohort and from baseline examination 6 for the offspring cohort and ended December 31, 2014. The analyses were conducted in 2017. Participants were 6197 individuals with 3478 deaths during a mean of 17 years of follow-up. Main Outcomes and Measures: Maximum BMI over 24 years of weight history before the beginning of follow-up for all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality. All-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality (deaths due to cardiovascular disease, cancer, or other causes). Results: Among 6197 participants (mean [SD] age at baseline, 62.79 [8.98] years; 55.5% female), 3478 (56.1%) died during the follow-up. A monotonic association was observed between maximum BMI and mortality, with increasing risks observed across obese I (BMI of 30 to <35; hazard ratio [HR], 1.27; 95% CI, 1.14-1.41) and obese II (BMI of 35 to <40; HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.68-2.20) categories.

Conclusions and Relevance: A monotonic association was found between maximum BMI over 24 years of weight history and subsequent all-cause mortality. Maximum BMI in the normal-weight range was associated with the lowest risk of mortality in this cohort, highlighting the importance of obesity prevention.","publicationTitle":"JAMA Netw Open","volume":"1","issue":"7","pages":"e184587","date":"2018-11","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:15Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:15Z"}},{"key":"XULGS6NH","version":7,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/XULGS6NH","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/XULGS6NH","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Ammann et al.","parsedDate":"2019-07","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"XULGS6NH","version":7,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Assessment of obesity prevalence and validity of obesity diagnoses coded in claims data for selected surgical populations: A retrospective, observational study","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Eric M","lastName":"Ammann"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Iftekhar","lastName":"Kalsekar"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Yoo"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Robin","lastName":"Scamuffa"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Chia-Wen","lastName":"Hsiao"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew C","lastName":"Stokes"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"John M","lastName":"Morton"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Stephen S","lastName":"Johnston"}],"abstractNote":"In many types of surgery, obesity may influence patient selection, prognosis, and/or management. Quantifying the accuracy of the coding of obesity and other prognostic factors is important for the design and interpretation of studies of surgical outcomes based on administrative healthcare data. This study assessed the validity of obesity diagnoses recorded in insurance claims data in selected surgical populations.This was a retrospective, observational study. Deidentified electronic health record (EHR) and linked administrative claims data were obtained for US patients age $\\geq$20 years who underwent a qualifying surgical procedure (bariatric surgery, total knee arthroplasty [TKA], cardiac ablation, or hernia repair) in 2014Q1-2017Q1 (first = index). Patients' body mass index (BMI) as coded in the claims data (error-prone measure) during the index procedure or 180d pre-index was compared with their measured BMI as recorded in the EHR (criterion standard) to estimate the sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of obesity diagnosis codes.Among patients who underwent bariatric surgery (N = 1422), TKA (N = 8670), cardiac ablation (N = 167), or hernia repair (N = 5450), obesity was present in 98%, 63%, 52%, and 54%, respectively, based on measured BMI. PPVs of obesity diagnosis codes were high: 99.3%, 96.0%, 92.8%, and 94.1% in bariatric surgery, TKA, cardiac ablation, and hernia repair, respectively. The sensitivity of obesity diagnoses was: 99.8%, 46.2%, 41.3%, and 42.3% in bariatric surgery, TKA, cardiac ablation, and hernia repair, respectively. Among false-positive patients diagnosed as obese but with measured BMI <30, the proportion with a BMI $\\geq$28 was 40.0%, 67.6%, 60.7%, and 65.8% for bariatric surgery, TKA, cardiac ablation, and hernia repair, respectively.Our data indicate that obesity is highly prevalent in many surgical populations, obesity diagnosis codes have high PPVs, but also obesity is generally undercoded in claims data. Quantifying the validity of diagnosis codes for obesity and other important prognostic factors is important for the design and interpretation of studies of surgical outcomes based on administrative data. Further research is needed to determine the extent to which undercoding of BMI and obesity can be addressed through the use of proxies that may be better documented in claims data.","publicationTitle":"Medicine","volume":"98","issue":"29","pages":"e16438","date":"2019-07","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:15Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:15Z"}},{"key":"8PKGMA7H","version":7,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/8PKGMA7H","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/8PKGMA7H","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Harlow et al.","parsedDate":"2019-09","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"8PKGMA7H","version":7,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Socioeconomic and Racial/Ethnic Differences in E-Cigarette Uptake Among Cigarette Smokers: Longitudinal Analysis of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Alyssa F","lastName":"Harlow"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Stokes"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Daniel R","lastName":"Brooks"}],"abstractNote":"INTRODUCTION: Sociodemographic differences in electronic cigarette use among cigarette smokers have not been previously characterized in the US adult population. METHODS: We analyzed longitudinal data from Waves 1 and 2 of the nationally representative Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) study. Differences by income (based on federal poverty level (FPL)) and race/ethnicity in e-cigarette uptake at Wave 2 among cigarette smokers who were e-cigarette nonusers at Wave 1 were assessed using binomial and multinomial logistic regression. We differentiated e-cigarette users who quit cigarettes (exclusive users) from those who did not quit cigarettes (dual users). E-cigarette-related attitudes/beliefs were evaluated to understand potential contributions to sociodemographic differences in e-cigarette uptake and use patterns. RESULTS: Among 6592 smokers who were e-cigarette nonusers at Wave 1, 13.5% began using e-cigarettes at Wave 2, of whom 91.3% were dual users. Compared with non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanics were less likely to become exclusive e-cigarette users (OR [Blacks] = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.09 to 0.77; OR [Hispanics] = 0.26, 95% CI = 0.09 to 0.70). Low-income smokers were less likely than higher-income smokers to become exclusive e-cigarette users (OR [<100% FPL vs. $\\geq$200% FPL] = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.27 to 0.89). Black, Hispanic, and low-income smokers were more likely to believe e-cigarettes are more harmful than cigarettes and to have positive tobacco-related social norms. CONCLUSIONS: Black, Hispanic, and low-income smokers were less likely than White and higher-income smokers to begin using e-cigarettes in the context of quitting cigarettes. Differences in e-cigarette uptake may be partly explained by perceived harm or social norms of e-cigarettes. IMPLICATIONS: Results of this study show that the exclusive use of e-cigarettes is more prevalent in higher-income and White smokers. Our data suggest that higher-income and White smokers may be more likely to use e-cigarettes as a means to quit combustible cigarettes compared with low-income and racial/ethnic minority smokers. These findings suggest that sociodemographic differences in e-cigarette uptake and use patterns may contribute to widening disparities in cigarette smoking.","publicationTitle":"Nicotine Tob.

In multivariable adjusted models, former e-cigarette users had 1.60-fold (95% CI, 1.54-1.67) higher odds of reporting a history of clinical diagnosis of depression than never users, whereas current e-cigarette users had 2.10 (95% CI, 1.98-2.23) times higher odds. Additionally, higher odds of reporting depression were observed with increased frequency of use among current e-cigarette users compared with never users (daily use: odds ratio, 2.39; 95% CI, 2.19-2.61; occasional use: odds ratio, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.82-2.10). Similar results were seen in subgroup analyses by sex, race/ethnicity, smoking status, and student status. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found a significant cross-sectional association between e-cigarette use and depression, which highlights the need for prospective studies analyzing the longitudinal risk of depression with e-cigarette use. If confirmed by other study designs, the potential mental health consequences may have regulatory implications for novel tobacco products.","publicationTitle":"JAMA Netw Open","volume":"2","issue":"12","pages":"e1916800","date":"2019-12","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:15Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:15Z"}},{"key":"SC9NMRDE","version":7,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/SC9NMRDE","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/SC9NMRDE","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Gupta et al.","parsedDate":"2019-12","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"SC9NMRDE","version":7,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Predictors of dental care use, unmet dental care need, and barriers to unmet need among women: results from NHANES, 2011 to 2016","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Avni","lastName":"Gupta"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Sarah","lastName":"Feldman"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Rebecca B","lastName":"Perkins"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Stokes"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Vidya","lastName":"Sankar"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Villa"}],"abstractNote":"OBJECTIVES: To examine socio-demographic and economic predictors of dental care access among women in the United States. METHODS: A total of 52,493,940 women at the US national level aged 20-44 years were identified from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2011 to 2016. Weighted multivariate logistic regression models were computed to identify predictors of dental care use, unmet dental-care need, and reported reasons for unmet need. RESULTS: Young, Mexican-American, other minority race-ethnicities, less educated, and uninsured women were independently more likely to have never visited a dental clinic (P < 0.025). Mexican-Americanwomen with a poverty income ratio (PIR) <2.00 and less than excellent health status and those uninsured were independently more likely to have unmet dental need (P < 0.025). Women with PIR <1.00 and those uninsured were independently more likely to have an unmet need because of unaffordable cost (P < 0.0008) or lack of procedure coverage by insurance (P < 0.0008). Younger women were more likely to think that the dental problem would go away (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: While young, less educated, and women from minority race-ethnicities were less likely to report ever use of dental care, only low income, poor health, and uninsured women were more likely to report unmet dental care need. Racial-ethnic minority, less educated, and young women may benefit from improved education about the value of dental care. Expanding insurance coverage for dental care and improving access for women with poor health may address racial-ethnic and education-level disparities in unmet dental care need.","publicationTitle":"J.

Objective: To evaluate trends in prescription opioid use and nonopioid analgesic use among adults with functional limitations attributable to musculoskeletal conditions. Design, Setting, and Participants: This repeated cross-sectional study uses data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Study from 1999 to 2016. Data were analyzed from January to July 2019. The participants were adults aged 30 to 79 years who reported functional limitations due to back or neck problems and/or arthritis or rheumatism. Main Outcomes and Measures: Any use of a prescription opioid or exclusive use of a prescription nonopioid analgesic. Results: In this population of 7256 adults with 1 or more functional limitations attributable to a musculoskeletal condition (4226 women [59.9%]; 3508 [74.4%] non-Hispanic white individuals; median [interquartile range] age, 63 [53-70] years), opioid use and exclusive nonopioid analgesic use exhibited approximately reciprocal patterns of change from 1999 to 2016. Opioid use increased significantly (difference in prevalence for 2015-2016 vs 1999-2000, 7.2%; 95% CI, 1.3% to 13%; P for trend = .002), and exclusive use of nonopioid analgesics decreased significantly (difference in prevalence for 2015-2016 vs 1999-2000, -13%; 95% CI, -19% to -7.5%; P for trend < .001) during this period. The increase in any opioid use was driven by long-term rather than short-term use. A crossover in the prevalence of opioid use and exclusive use of nonopioid analgesics occurred between 2003 and 2006, after which opioid use was more prevalent. Between 2013 and 2016, decreases in opioid use were observed among men (difference in prevalence for 2015-2016 vs 2013-2014, -11%; 95% CI, -21% to 1.8%) and participants with less than a high school education (difference, -15%; 95% CI, -24% to -6.1%). During this same period, exclusive nonopioid analgesic use also decreased markedly across the population (difference, -5.3%; 95% CI, -9.1% to -1.5%). Conclusions and Relevance: The substitution of opioids for nonopioid analgesics between 2003 and 2006 may have occurred as evidence emerged on the cardiovascular risks associated with nonopioid analgesics. Reductions in opioid use between 2013 and 2016 were most substantial among those with low socioeconomic status, who may encounter barriers in accessing alternatives. Despite those decreases, opioid use remained more prevalent in 2015 to 2016 than in 1999 to 2000, suggesting a potentially long tail for the opioid epidemic.","publicationTitle":"JAMA Netw Open","volume":"2","issue":"12","pages":"e1917228","date":"2019-12","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:15Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:15Z"}},{"key":"LGR636DZ","version":7,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/LGR636DZ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/LGR636DZ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Banack et al.","parsedDate":"2020-01","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"LGR636DZ","version":7,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"It's Absolutely Relative: The Effect of Age on the BMI-Mortality Relationship in Postmenopausal Women","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Hailey R","lastName":"Banack"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jennifer W","lastName":"Bea"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Stokes"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Candyce H","lastName":"Kroenke"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Marcia L","lastName":"Stefanick"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Shirley A","lastName":"Beresford"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Chloe E","lastName":"Bird"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Lorena","lastName":"Garcia"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Wallace"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Robert A","lastName":"Wild"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Bette","lastName":"Caan"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Wactawski-Wende"}],"abstractNote":"OBJECTIVE: The use of relative and absolute effect estimates has important implications for the interpretation of study findings. Likewise, examining additive and multiplicative interaction can lead to differing conclusions about the joint effects of two exposure variables.

METHODS: Data from 68,132 participants in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study were used. The risk ratio and risk difference of BMI on mortality were estimated. A product term was also included to examine interaction between BMI and age on the multiplicative scale, and the relative excess risk of interaction was calculated to measure additive interaction. RESULTS: Results demonstrated that the mortality risk ratio decreased as women aged, but the mortality risk difference increased as women aged. Evidence of additive and multiplicative interaction between age and BMI was found. CONCLUSIONS: In postmenopausal women, the relative mortality risk associated with high BMI decreased with increasing age, but the absolute risk of high BMI increased with increasing age. This indicates the importance of considering the interaction between age and BMI to understand mortality risk in older women.","publicationTitle":"Obesity","volume":"28","issue":"1","pages":"171–177","date":"2020-01","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","extra":"Publisher: Wiley","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:15Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:15Z"}},{"key":"NIE7GXZV","version":7,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/NIE7GXZV","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/NIE7GXZV","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Mutyambizi et al.","parsedDate":"2019-01","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"NIE7GXZV","version":7,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Lifestyle and socio-economic inequalities in diabetes prevalence in South Africa: A decomposition analysis","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Chipo","lastName":"Mutyambizi"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Frederik","lastName":"Booysen"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Stokes"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Milena","lastName":"Pavlova"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Wim","lastName":"Groot"}],"abstractNote":"BACKGROUND: Inequalities in diabetes are widespread and are exacerbated by differences in lifestyle. Many studies that have estimated inequalities in diabetes make use of self-reported diabetes which is often biased by differences in access to health care and diabetes awareness. This study adds to this literature by making use of a more objective standardised measure of diabetes in South Africa. The study estimates socio-economic inequalities in undiagnosed diabetes, diagnosed diabetes (self-reported), as well as total diabetes (undiagnosed diabetics + diagnosed diabetics). The study also examines the contribution of lifestyle factors to diabetes inequalities in South Africa. METHODS: This cross sectional study uses data from the 2012 South African National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (SANHANES-1) and applies the Erreygers Concentration Indices to assess socio-economic inequalities in diabetes. Contributions of lifestyle factors to inequalities in diabetes are assessed using a decomposition method. RESULTS: Self-reported diabetes and total diabetes (undiagnosed diabetics + diagnosed diabetics) were significantly concentrated amongst the rich (CI = 0.0746; p < 0.05 and CI = 0.0859; p < 0.05). The concentration index for undiagnosed diabetes was insignificant but pro-poor. The decomposition showed that lifestyle factors contributed 22% and 35% to socioeconomic inequalities in self-reported and total diabetes, respectively. CONCLUSION: Diabetes in South Africa is more concentrated amongst higher socio-economic groups when measured using self-reported diabetes or clinical data. Our findings also show that the extent of inequality is worse in the total diabetes outcome (undiagnosed diabetics + diagnosed diabetics) when compared to the self-reported diabetes outcome. Although in comparison to other determinants, the contribution of lifestyle factors was modest, these contributions are important in the development of policies that address socio-economic inequalities in the prevalence of diabetes.","publicationTitle":"PLoS One","volume":"14","issue":"1","pages":"e0211208","date":"2019-01","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:15Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:15Z"}},{"key":"QSX32GAV","version":7,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/QSX32GAV","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/QSX32GAV","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Stokes et al.","parsedDate":"2019-10","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"QSX32GAV","version":7,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The contribution of obesity to prescription opioid use in the United States","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Stokes"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Kaitlyn M","lastName":"Berry"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jason M","lastName":"Collins"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Chia-Wen","lastName":"Hsiao"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jason R","lastName":"Waggoner"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Stephen S","lastName":"Johnston"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Eric M","lastName":"Ammann"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Robin F","lastName":"Scamuffa"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Sonia","lastName":"Lee"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Dielle J","lastName":"Lundberg"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Daniel H","lastName":"Solomon"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"David T","lastName":"Felson"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Tuhina","lastName":"Neogi"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Joann E","lastName":"Manson"}],"abstractNote":"The prevalence of obesity has grown rapidly over the past several decades and has been accompanied by an increase in the prevalence of chronic pain and prescription opioid use. Obesity, through its association with pain, may represent an important contributor to opioid use. This cross-sectional study investigated the relationship between obesity and prescription opioid use among adults aged 35 to 79 years using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, 2003-2016). Relative to normal weight, body mass indices in the overweight {odds ratio (OR), 1.11 (confidence interval [CI], 0.88-1.39)}, obese I (OR, 1.26 [CI, 1.01-1.57]), obese II (OR, 1.69 [CI, 1.34-2.12]), and obese III (OR, 2.33 [CI, 1.76-3.08]) categories were associated with elevated odds of prescription opioid use. The association between excess weight and opioid use was stronger for chronic opioid use than for use with a duration of less than 90 days (P-value, <0.001). We estimated that 14% (CI, 9%-19%) of prescription opioid use at the population level was attributable to obesity, suggesting there might have been 1.5 million fewer opioid users per year under the hypothetical scenario where obese individuals were instead nonobese (CI, 0.9-2.0 million users). Back pain, joint pain, and muscle/nerve pain accounted for the largest differences in self-reported reasons for prescription opioid use across obesity status. Although interpretation is limited by the cross-sectional nature of the associations, our findings suggest that the obesity epidemic may be partially responsible for the high prevalence of prescription opioid use in the United States.","publicationTitle":"Pain","volume":"160","issue":"10","pages":"2255–2262","date":"2019-10","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:15Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:15Z"}},{"key":"4LMZVB5F","version":7,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/4LMZVB5F","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/4LMZVB5F","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Johnston et al.","parsedDate":"2020-04","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"4LMZVB5F","version":7,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Association of body mass index and osteoarthritis with healthcare expenditures and utilization","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Stephen S","lastName":"Johnston"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Ammann"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Robin","lastName":"Scamuffa"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Samuels"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Stokes"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Elliott","lastName":"Fegelman"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Chia-Wen","lastName":"Hsiao"}],"abstractNote":"OBJECTIVE: Osteoarthritis is highly prevalent and, on aggregate, is one of the largest contributors to US spending on hospital-based health care.

Objective: To examine the risk of all-cause mortality among adults who lost weight between early adulthood and midlife compared with adults who were persistently obese over the same period. Design, Setting, and Participants: Combined repeated cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III (1988-1994) and continuous waves collected in 2-year cycles between 1999 and 2014. The data analysis was conducted from February 10, 2019, to April 20, 2020. Individuals aged 40 to 74 years at the time of survey (baseline) were included in the analyses (n = 24 205). Exposures: Weight history was assessed by self-reported weight at age 25 years, at 10 years before baseline (midlife: mean age, 44 years; interquartile range, 37-55), and measured weight at baseline. Body mass index (BMI) (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) at each time was categorized as normal (18.5-24.9), overweight (25.0-29.9), and obese ($\\geq$30.0). Weight change patterns were assessed from age 25 years (early adulthood) to 10 years before baseline (midlife). Main Outcomes and Measures: Incident all-cause mortality using linked data from the National Death Index. Results: Of the 24 205 participants, 11 617 were women (49.0%) and 11 567 were non-Hispanic White (76.9%). The mean (SD) BMI was 29.0 (6.1) at baseline. During a mean (SD) follow-up of 10.7 (7.2) years, 5846 deaths occurred. Weight loss from obese to overweight was associated with a 54% (hazard ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.27-0.77) reduction in mortality risk compared with individuals with stable obesity between early adulthood and midlife. An estimated 3.2% (95% CI, 1.6%-4.9%) of early deaths could have been avoided if those who maintained an obese BMI instead lost weight to an overweight BMI by midlife. Overall, an estimated 12.4% (95% CI, 8.1%-16.5%) of early deaths may be attributable to having weight in excess of the normal BMI range at any point between early and mid-adulthood. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, weight loss from obesity to overweight between early adulthood through midlife appeared to be associated with a mortality risk reduction compared with persistent obesity. These findings support the importance of population-based approaches to preventing weight gain across the life course and a need for greater emphasis on treating obesity early in life.","publicationTitle":"JAMA Netw Open","volume":"3","issue":"8","pages":"e2013448","date":"2020-08","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:14Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:14Z"}},{"key":"WNYAUS7N","version":6,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/WNYAUS7N","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/WNYAUS7N","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Xie et al.","parsedDate":"2020-11","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"WNYAUS7N","version":6,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Association of Electronic Cigarette Use With Incident Respiratory Conditions Among US Adults From 2013 to 2018","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Wubin","lastName":"Xie"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Hasmeena","lastName":"Kathuria"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Panagis","lastName":"Galiatsatos"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Michael J","lastName":"Blaha"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Naomi M","lastName":"Hamburg"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Rose Marie","lastName":"Robertson"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Aruni","lastName":"Bhatnagar"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Emelia J","lastName":"Benjamin"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew C","lastName":"Stokes"}],"abstractNote":"Importance: Generating robust and timely evidence about the respiratory health risks of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) is critical for informing state and federal regulatory standards for product safety.

Main Outcomes and Measures: Incident respiratory conditions, including COPD, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and asthma, as well as a composite respiratory disease encompassing all 4 conditions. Results: Among 21 618 respondents included in the analyses, 11 017 (491%) were men and 12 969 (65.2%) were non-Hispanic White. A total of 14 213 respondents were never e-cigarette users, 5076 respondents (11.6%) were former e-cigarette users, and 2329 respondents (5.2%) were current e-cigarette users. Adjusted for cigarette and other combustible tobacco product use, demographic characteristics, and chronic health conditions, there was an increased risk of respiratory disease among former e-cigarette uses (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.28; 95% CI, 1.09-1.50) and current e-cigarette users (IRR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.08-1.59). Among respondents with good self-rated health, the IRR for former e-cigarette users was 1.21 (95%CI, 1.00-1.46) and the IRR for current e-cigarette users was 1.43 (95% CI, 1.14-1.79). For specific respiratory diseases among current e-cigarette users, the IRR was 1.33 (95% CI, 1.06-1.67) for chronic bronchitis, 1.69 (95% CI, 1.15-2.49) for emphysema, 1.57 (95% CI, 1.15-2.13) for COPD, and 1.31 (95% CI, 1.01-1.71) for asthma. Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study found that e-cigarette use was associated with an increased risk of developing respiratory disease independent of cigarette smoking. These findings add important evidence on the risk profile of novel tobacco products.","publicationTitle":"JAMA Netw Open","volume":"3","issue":"11","pages":"e2020816","date":"2020-11","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:14Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:14Z"}},{"key":"F7NIW5WT","version":6,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/F7NIW5WT","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/F7NIW5WT","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Harlow et al.","parsedDate":"2021-01","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"F7NIW5WT","version":6,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Association of Coming Out as Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual+ and Risk of Cigarette Smoking in a Nationally Representative Sample of Youth and Young Adults","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Alyssa F","lastName":"Harlow"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Dielle","lastName":"Lundberg"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Julia R","lastName":"Raifman"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andy S L","lastName":"Tan"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Carl G, Jr","lastName":"Streed"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Emelia J","lastName":"Benjamin"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew C","lastName":"Stokes"}],"abstractNote":"Importance: Coming out as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or other identities besides heterosexual (LGB+) may represent a susceptible period for cigarette smoking initiation in youth and young adults. Objective: To assess whether young people who change their sexual identity have higher risk of cigarette smoking initiation and current smoking compared with those with consistent sexual identities. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used data from the nationally representative Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health study (wave 1, 2013-2014; wave 2, 2014-2015; wave 3, 2015-2016; wave 4, 2016-2018). Youth and young adults aged 14 to 29 years who were never smokers at wave 1 were included in this study. Analysis began October 2018 and ended June 2020. Exposures: Consistent sexual identity (consistently heterosexual, consistently LGB+) vs changing sexual identity (coming out as LGB+, other LGB+ patterns) based on 4 waves of sexual identity data. Identities were further classified by distinguishing between bisexual and lesbian, gay, and other nonheterosexual identities. Main Outcomes and Measures: Smoking initiation and current cigarette smoking at wave 4. Results: Among 7843 individuals who never smoked at wave 1, 6991 (90.7%) reported a consistent sexual identity, and 852 (9.3%) changed sexual identity across waves. The mean (SE) baseline age of participants who reported consistent heterosexuality was 20.1 (0.8) years; consistently LGB+, 20.0 (3.7) years; coming out as LGB+, 18.0 (2.9) years, and other LGB+ pattern, 20.3 (3.8) years. A total of 14.1% (weighted) initiated smoking, and 6.3% were current smokers at wave 4. Compared with consistently heterosexual identities, coming out as LGB+ (23% vs 13%; odds ratio [OR], 1.72; 95% CI, 1.34-2.20), consistently LGB+ identities (17% vs 13%; OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.03-2.04), and other LGB+ patterns (17% vs 13%; OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.04-2.08) were positively associated with smoking initiation by wave 4. Compared with consistently heterosexual identities, ORs for smoking initiation were 2.24 (28% vs 13%; 95% CI, 1.72-2.92) for coming out as bisexual, 1.99 (23% vs 13%; 95% CI, 1.20-3.29) for consistently LGB+ with change to/from bisexual, and 2.20 (23% vs 13%; 95% CI, 1.40-3.46) for other LGB+ patterns with change to/from bisexual identity. Current smoking estimates were similar to those for smoking initiation. Conclusions and Relevance: Compared with consistently heterosexual identities, changing sexual identity over follow-up was associated with smoking initiation and current smoking. The risk associated with changing sexual identities was concentrated among participants coming out as bisexual or reporting other changes in their identity to/from being bisexual. More research is needed on mechanisms underlying the association between changing sexual identity and smoking initiation to inform tailored prevention programs and tobacco regulations.","publicationTitle":"JAMA Pediatr.","volume":"175","issue":"1","pages":"56–63","date":"2021-01","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:14Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:14Z"}},{"key":"BV6ERLL8","version":6,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/BV6ERLL8","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/BV6ERLL8","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Yan et al.","parsedDate":"2020-01","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"BV6ERLL8","version":6,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Universal coverage but unmet need: National and regional estimates of attrition across the diabetes care continuum in Thailand","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Lily D","lastName":"Yan"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Piya","lastName":"Hanvoravongchai"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Wichai","lastName":"Aekplakorn"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Suwat","lastName":"Chariyalertsak"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Pattapong","lastName":"Kessomboon"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Sawitri","lastName":"Assanangkornchai"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Surasak","lastName":"Taneepanichskul"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Nareemarn","lastName":"Neelapaichit"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew C","lastName":"Stokes"}],"abstractNote":"BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a growing challenge in Thailand. Data to assess health system response to diabetes is scarce. We assessed what factors influence diabetes care cascade retention, under universal health coverage. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the 2014 Thai National Health Examination Survey. Diabetes was defined as fasting plasma glucose $\\geq$126mg/dL or on treatment. National and regional care cascades were constructed across screening, diagnosis, treatment, and control. Unmet need was defined as the total loss across cascade levels. Logistic regression was used to examine the demographic and healthcare factors associated with cascade attrition. FINDINGS: We included 15,663 individuals. Among Thai adults aged 20+ with diabetes, 67.0% (95% CI 60.9% to 73.1%) were screened, 34.0% (95% CI 30.6% to 37.2%) were diagnosed, 33.3% (95% CI 29.9% to 36.7%) were treated, and 26.0% (95% CI 22.9% to 29.1%) were controlled. Total unmet need was 74.0% (95% CI 70.9% to 77.1%), with regional variation ranging from 58.4% (95% CI 45.0% to 71.8%) in South to 78.0% (95% CI 73.0% to 83.0%) in Northeast. Multivariable models indicated older age (OR 1.76), males (OR 0.65), and a higher density of medical staff (OR 2.40) and health centers (OR 1.58) were significantly associated with being diagnosed among people with diabetes. Older age (OR 1.80) and higher geographical density of medical staff (OR 1.82) and health centers (OR 1.56) were significantly associated with being controlled. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial attrition in the diabetes care continuum was observed at diabetes screening and diagnosis, related to both individual and health system factors. Even with universal health insurance, Thailand still needs effective behavioral and structural interventions, especially in primary health care settings, to address unmet need in diabetes care for its population.","publicationTitle":"PLoS One","volume":"15","issue":"1","pages":"e0226286","date":"2020-01","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:14Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:14Z"}},{"key":"3I4YGMMC","version":6,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/3I4YGMMC","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/3I4YGMMC","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Glei et al.","parsedDate":"2020-02","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"3I4YGMMC","version":6,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Changes in mental health, pain, and drug misuse since the mid-1990s: Is there a link?","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Dana A","lastName":"Glei"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Stokes"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Maxine","lastName":"Weinstein"}],"abstractNote":"Drug-related mortality in the US grew dramatically in recent years, while mental health deteriorated among disadvantaged Americans and reported levels of pain increased over the same period. Here we investigate whether increased prevalence of drug misuse between the mid-1990s and early-2010s is associated with higher levels of mental distress and pain. Our results demonstrate higher drug misuse over this period, particularly for older and for socioeconomically disadvantaged Americans. After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, we estimate that the prevalence of drug misuse increased by 19 percentage points among those aged 50-76 in the bottom percentile of socioeconomic status (SES). Misuse increased much more at older than at younger ages for all drug types except sedatives, which increased to a similar degree in both age groups. Compared with measures of mental health, pain consistently accounted for a greater share of the period differential in drug misuse among both age groups and across all drug types. Misuse of prescription painkillers exhibited the largest difference in the contributions of pain versus mental health: among older individuals with the lowest SES, pain explained three times as much of the period trend as mental health (60% vs. 19%). Pain was more closely linked with the rise in misuse of prescription painkillers than other drugs. Mental health is a strong correlate of drug misuse (particularly sedative use), but growing drug misuse since the mid-1990s was more strongly linked with rising levels of reported pain than with deterioration in mental health. Pain could be a key factor underlying the association between trends in mental health and drug use: higher levels of pain may contribute to both mental distress and drug misuse. Given that pain, mental distress, and drug misuse are intertwined, successful intervention may require addressing all three factors.","publicationTitle":"Soc. Sci.

However, the pain conditions that are factors in this association remain unestablished. Objective: To investigate the association between obesity and pain diagnoses recorded by primary care clinicians as reasons for prescription of opioids. Design, Setting, and Participants: A cross-sectional study including 565 930 patients aged 35 to 64 years with a body mass index (BMI) measurement recorded in 2016 was conducted. Electronic health records of patients seen by primary care clinicians in the US in the multipayer athenahealth network from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2017, were reviewed, and data were analyzed from March 1 to September 15, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Any prescription of opioids in the 365 days before or after the first BMI measurement in 2016 were identified. All International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, claims within 7 days before each opioid prescription were captured and classified using a pain diagnosis typologic system. Weight was categorized as underweight (BMI, 18.5-19.9), normal weight (BMI, 20.0-24.9), overweight (BMI, 25.0-29.9), obese I (BMI, 30-34.9), obese II (BMI, 35.0-39.9), obese III (BMI, 40.0-49.9), and obese IV (BMI, 50.0-80.0). Results: Among 565 930 patients, 329 083 (58.1%) were women. A total of 125 093 patients (22.1%) were aged 35 to 44 years, 199 384 patients (35.2%) were 45 to 54 years, and 241 453 patients (42.7%) were 55 to 64 years. A total of 177 631 patients (31.4%) were overweight and 273 135 patients (48.2%) were obese at baseline. Over 2 years, 93 954 patients (16.6%) were prescribed opioids. The risk of receiving prescription opioids increased progressively with BMI (adjusted relative risk for overweight: 1.08; 95% CI, 1.06-1.10; obese I: 1.24; 95% CI, 1.22-1.26; obese II: 1.33; 95% CI, 1.30-1.36; obese III: 1.48; 95% CI, 1.45-1.51; and obese IV, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.65-1.77). The percentage of patients with opioid prescriptions attributable to an overweight or obese BMI was 16.2% (95% CI, 15.0%-17.4%). Prescription opioids for management of osteoarthritis (relative risk for obese vs normal weight, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.77-2.05) and other joint disorders (relative risk, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.55-1.72) both had stronger associations with obesity than the mean for any pain diagnosis (relative risk, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.31-1.36). Osteoarthritis, other joint disorders, and other back disorders comprised a combined 53.4% of the absolute difference in prescription of opioids by obesity. Conclusions and Relevance: Joint and back disorders appear to be the most important diagnoses in explaining the increased receipt of opioid prescriptions among patients with obesity. Addressing the opioid crisis will require attention to underlying sources of demand for prescription opioids, including obesity, through its associations with pain.","publicationTitle":"JAMA Netw Open","volume":"3","issue":"4","pages":"e202012","date":"2020-04","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:14Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:14Z"}},{"key":"PP8ZKD8J","version":6,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/PP8ZKD8J","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/PP8ZKD8J","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Davies et al.","parsedDate":"2020-11","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"PP8ZKD8J","version":6,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Association between country preparedness indicators and quality clinical care for cardiovascular disease risk factors in 44 lower- and middle-income countries: A multicountry analysis of survey data","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Justine I","lastName":"Davies"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Sumithra Krishnamurthy","lastName":"Reddiar"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Lisa R","lastName":"Hirschhorn"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Cara","lastName":"Ebert"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Maja-Emilia","lastName":"Marcus"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jacqueline A","lastName":"Seiglie"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Zhaxybay","lastName":"Zhumadilov"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Adil","lastName":"Supiyev"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Lela","lastName":"Sturua"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Bahendeka K","lastName":"Silver"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Abla M","lastName":"Sibai"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Sarah","lastName":"Quesnel-Crooks"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Bolormaa","lastName":"Norov"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Joseph K","lastName":"Mwangi"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Omar Mwalim","lastName":"Omar"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Roy","lastName":"Wong-McClure"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Mary T","lastName":"Mayige"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Joao S","lastName":"Martins"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Nuno","lastName":"Lunet"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Demetre","lastName":"Labadarios"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Khem B","lastName":"Karki"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Gibson B","lastName":"Kagaruki"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jutta M A","lastName":"Jorgensen"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Nahla C","lastName":"Hwalla"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Dismand","lastName":"Houinato"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Corine","lastName":"Houehanou"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"David","lastName":"Guwatudde"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Mongal S","lastName":"Gurung"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Bovet"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Brice W","lastName":"Bicaba"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Krishna K","lastName":"Aryal"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Msaidié"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Glennis","lastName":"Andall-Brereton"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Garry","lastName":"Brian"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Stokes"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Vollmer"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Till","lastName":"Bärnighausen"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Rifat","lastName":"Atun"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Geldsetzer"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jennifer","lastName":"Manne-Goehler"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Lindsay M","lastName":"Jaacks"}],"abstractNote":"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases are leading causes of death, globally, and health systems that deliver quality clinical care are needed to manage an increasing number of people with risk factors for these diseases. Indicators of preparedness of countries to manage cardiovascular disease risk factors (CVDRFs) are regularly collected by ministries of health and global health agencies. We aimed to assess whether these indicators are associated with patient receipt of quality clinical care. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We did a secondary analysis of cross-sectional, nationally representative, individual-patient data from 187,552 people with hypertension (mean age 48.1 years, 53.5% female) living in 43 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and 40,795 people with diabetes (mean age 52.2 years, 57.7% female) living in 28 LMICs on progress through cascades of care (condition diagnosed, treated, or controlled) for diabetes or hypertension, to indicate outcomes of provision of quality clinical care. Data were extracted from national-level World Health Organization (WHO) Stepwise Approach to Surveillance (STEPS), or other similar household surveys, conducted between July 2005 and November 2016. We used mixed-effects logistic regression to estimate associations between each quality clinical care outcome and indicators of country development (gross domestic product [GDP] per capita or Human Development Index [HDI]); national capacity for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases ('NCD readiness indicators' from surveys done by WHO); health system finance (domestic government expenditure on health [as percentage of GDP], private, and out-of-pocket expenditure on health [both as percentage of current]); and health service readiness (number of physicians, nurses, or hospital beds per 1,000 people) and performance (neonatal mortality rate). All models were adjusted for individual-level predictors including age, sex, and education. In an exploratory analysis, we tested whether national-level data on facility preparedness for diabetes were positively associated with outcomes. Associations were inconsistent between indicators and quality clinical care outcomes. For hypertension, GDP and HDI were both positively associated with each outcome. Of the 33 relationships tested between NCD readiness indicators and outcomes, only two showed a significant positive association: presence of guidelines with being diagnosed (odds ratio [OR], 1.86 [95% CI 1.08-3.21], p = 0.03) and availability of funding with being controlled (OR, 2.26 [95% CI 1.09-4.69], p = 0.03). Hospital beds (OR, 1.14 [95% CI 1.02-1.27], p = 0.02), nurses/midwives (OR, 1.24 [95% CI 1.06-1.44], p = 0.006), and physicians (OR, 1.21 [95% CI 1.11-1.32], p < 0.001) per 1,000 people were positively associated with being diagnosed and, similarly, with being treated; and the number of physicians was additionally associated with being controlled (OR, 1.12 [95% CI 1.01-1.23], p = 0.03). For diabetes, no positive associations were seen between NCD readiness indicators and outcomes. There was no association between country development, health service finance, or health service performance and readiness indicators and any outcome, apart from GDP (OR, 1.70 [95% CI 1.12-2.59], p = 0.01), HDI (OR, 1.21 [95% CI 1.01-1.44], p = 0.04), and number of physicians per 1,000 people (OR, 1.28 [95% CI 1.09-1.51], p = 0.003), which were associated with being diagnosed. Six countries had data on cascades of care and nationwide-level data on facility preparedness. Of the 27 associations tested between facility preparedness indicators and outcomes, the only association that was significant was having metformin available, which was positively associated with treatment (OR, 1.35 [95% CI 1.01-1.81], p = 0.04). The main limitation was use of blood pressure measurement on a single occasion to diagnose hypertension and a single blood glucose measurement to diagnose diabetes. CONCLUSION: In this study, we observed that indicators of country preparedness to deal with CVDRFs are poor proxies for quality clinical care received by patients for hypertension and diabetes. The major implication is that assessments of countries' preparedness to manage CVDRFs should not rely on proxies; rather, it should involve direct assessment of quality clinical care.","publicationTitle":"PLoS Med.","volume":"17","issue":"11","pages":"e1003268","date":"2020-11","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:14Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:14Z"}},{"key":"4MWG827A","version":6,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/4MWG827A","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/4MWG827A","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Barrington-Trimis et al.","parsedDate":"2020-10","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"4MWG827A","version":6,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Trends in the Age of Cigarette Smoking Initiation Among Young Adults in the US From 2002 to 2018","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jessica L","lastName":"Barrington-Trimis"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jessica L","lastName":"Braymiller"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jennifer B","lastName":"Unger"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Rob","lastName":"McConnell"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Stokes"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Adam M","lastName":"Leventhal"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"James D","lastName":"Sargent"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jonathan M","lastName":"Samet"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Renee D","lastName":"Goodwin"}],"abstractNote":"Importance: Success in reducing the prevalence of adolescent smoking could reflect complete prevention of smoking initiation or a shift in the age of cigarette smoking initiation from adolescence into early adulthood.

Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes were population-weighted cigarette smoking prevalence and cigarette smoking initiation and transition to daily smoking in adolescence (age <18 years) vs early adulthood (ages 18-23 years). Results: Among 71 756 young adults aged 22 to 23 years (38 226 women [50.5%]), ever cigarette smoking prevalence decreased from a population-weighted estimate of 74.6% (95% CI, 73.1%-75.9%) in 2002 to 51.4% (95% CI, 49.3%-53.5%) in 2018 (P < .001). Daily smoking prevalence rates similarly decreased from 41.1% (95% CI, 39.1%-43.1%) in 2002 to 20.2% (95% CI, 18.6%-21.8%) in 2018 (P < .001). However, among 48 015 ever smokers, the proportion initiating smoking in early adulthood (ages 18-23 years) increased over this time, from 20.6% (95% CI, 18.5%-22.8%) in 2002 to 42.6% (95% CI, 39.6%-45.7%) in 2018 (P < .001). Similarly, among 24 490 daily cigarette smokers, the proportion who transitioned to daily smoking in early adulthood increased from 38.7% (95% CI, 35.9%-41.6%) in 2002 to 55.9% (95% CI, 52.0%-59.8%) in 2018 (P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: A substantial proportion of beginning smokers and most new daily smokers are now young adults, reflecting a shift from adolescence to early adulthood, a population segment once considered beyond the critical risk period for cigarette smoking onset. Expanding the long-standing emphasis on adolescent surveillance and prevention in adolescence to include the young adult population is warranted.","publicationTitle":"JAMA Netw Open","volume":"3","issue":"10","pages":"e2019022","date":"2020-10","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:14Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:14Z"}},{"key":"HIQDBZZ8","version":6,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/HIQDBZZ8","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/HIQDBZZ8","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Stokes et al.","parsedDate":"2020-12","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"HIQDBZZ8","version":6,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Estimates of the Association of Dementia With US Mortality Levels Using Linked Survey and Mortality Records","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew C","lastName":"Stokes"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jordan","lastName":"Weiss"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Dielle J","lastName":"Lundberg"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Wubin","lastName":"Xie"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jung Ki","lastName":"Kim"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Samuel H","lastName":"Preston"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Eileen M","lastName":"Crimmins"}],"abstractNote":"Importance: Vital statistics are the primary source of data used to understand the mortality burden of dementia in the US, despite evidence that dementia is underreported on death certificates. Alternative estimates, drawing on population-based samples, are needed. Objective: To estimate the percentage of deaths attributable to dementia in the US. Design, Setting, and Participants: A prospective cohort study of the Health and Retirement Study of noninstitutionalized US individuals with baseline exposure assessment in 2000 and follow-up through 2009 was conducted. Data were analyzed from November 2018 to May 2020. The sample was drawn from 7489 adults aged 70 to 99 years interviewed directly or by proxy. Ninety participants with missing covariates or sample weights and 57 participants lost to follow-up were excluded. The final analytic sample included 7342 adults. Exposure: Dementia and cognitive impairment without dementia (CIND) were identified at baseline using Health and Retirement Study self- or proxy-reported cognitive measures and the validated Langa-Weir score cutoff. Main Outcomes and Measures: Hazard ratios relating dementia and CIND status to all-cause mortality were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression models, accounting for covariates, and were used to calculate population-attributable fractions. Results were compared with information on cause of death from death certificates. Results: Of the 7342 total sample, 4348 participants (60.3%) were women. At baseline, 4533 individuals (64.0%) were between ages 70 and 79 years, 2393 individuals (31.0%) were between 80 and 89 years, and 416 individuals (5.0%) were between 90 and 99 years; percentages were weighted. The percentage of deaths attributable to dementia was 13.6% (95% CI, 12.2%-15.0%) between 2000 and 2009. The mortality burden of dementia was significantly higher among non-Hispanic Black participants (24.7%; 95% CI, 17.3-31.4) than non-Hispanic White participants (12.2%; 95% CI, 10.7-13.6) and among adults with less than a high school education (16.2%; 95% CI, 13.2%-19.0%) compared with those with a college education (9.8%; 95% CI, 7.0%-12.5%). Underlying cause of death recorded on death certificates (5.0%; 95% CI, 4.3%-5.8%) underestimated the contribution of dementia to US mortality by a factor of 2.7. Incorporating deaths attributable to CIND revealed an even greater underestimation. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this study suggest that the mortality burden associated with dementia is underestimated using vital statistics, especially when considering CIND in addition to dementia.","publicationTitle":"JAMA Neurol.","volume":"77","issue":"12","pages":"1543–1550","date":"2020-12","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:14Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:14Z"}},{"key":"YLVUFVQK","version":6,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/YLVUFVQK","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/YLVUFVQK","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Harlow et al.","parsedDate":"2022-08","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"YLVUFVQK","version":6,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Association of device type, flavours and vaping behaviour with tobacco product transitions among adult electronic cigarette users in the USA","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Alyssa F","lastName":"Harlow"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jessica L","lastName":"Fetterman"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Craig S","lastName":"Ross"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Rose Marie","lastName":"Robertson"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Aruni","lastName":"Bhatnagar"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Emelia J","lastName":"Benjamin"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew C","lastName":"Stokes"}],"abstractNote":"BACKGROUND: Few studies assess whether electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) device characteristics or flavours impact longitudinal patterns of cigarette and e-cigarette use. DESIGN: We examined data from waves 2-4 of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study (2014-2018). Among adult ($\\geq$18 years) current e-cigarette users at wave 2 who were current smokers (dual users; n=1759) and former smokers (exclusive e-cigarette users; n=470), we classified participants into four use patterns at wave 3 ( 12 months later) and wave 4 ( 24 months later): (1) dual use of e-cigarettes and cigarettes; (2) exclusive cigarette smoking; (3) exclusive e-cigarette use; (4) non-use of both products. We used multinomial logistic regression to assess correlates of changing use patterns at 24 months, relative to no change, adjusting for sociodemographic factors. RESULTS: At 24 months, 26.5% of baseline exclusive e-cigarette users, and 9% of baseline dual users, abstained from both vaping and smoking. Participants who vaped non-tobacco flavours (vs tobacco flavours), and used refillable tank or modifiable devices (vs disposable, cartridges and other devices) were less likely to transition to non-use of both products and to exclusive cigarette smoking. Baseline daily vaping (vs non-daily) was positively associated with exclusive e-cigarette use at 24 months for baseline daily cigarette smokers, but negatively associated with exclusive e-cigarette use and non-use of both products at 24 months for baseline non-daily smokers. CONCLUSIONS: Non-tobacco flavours, daily vaping and modifiable e-cigarette devices may help some smokers abstain from cigarette smoking via transitioning to exclusive e-cigarette use, but are also associated with ongoing exclusive e-cigarette use.","publicationTitle":"Tob.

Many chronic diseases have been linked to risk factors such as poor diet and physical inactivity. Data for these behavioral risk factors are usually obtained from surveys, which can be delayed by years. Behavioral data from digital sources, including social media and search engines, could be used for timely monitoring of behavioral risk factors. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to propose the use of digital data from internet sources for monitoring changes in behavioral risk factors in Africa. METHODS: We obtained the adjusted volume of search queries submitted to Google for 108 terms related to diet, exercise, and disease from 2010 to 2016. We also obtained the obesity and overweight prevalence for 52 African countries from the World Health Organization (WHO) for the same period. Machine learning algorithms (ie, random forest, support vector machine, Bayes generalized linear model, gradient boosting, and an ensemble of the individual methods) were used to identify search terms and patterns that correlate with changes in obesity and overweight prevalence across Africa. Out-of-sample predictions were used to assess and validate the model performance. RESULTS: The study included 52 African countries. In 2016, the WHO reported an overweight prevalence ranging from 20.9% (95% credible interval [CI] 17.1%-25.0%) to 66.8% (95% CI 62.4%-71.0%) and an obesity prevalence ranging from 4.5% (95% CI 2.9%-6.5%) to 32.5% (95% CI 27.2%-38.1%) in Africa. The highest obesity and overweight prevalence were noted in the northern and southern regions. Google searches for diet-, exercise-, and obesity-related terms explained 97.3% (root-mean-square error [RMSE] 1.15) of the variation in obesity prevalence across all 52 countries. Similarly, the search data explained 96.6% (RMSE 2.26) of the variation in the overweight prevalence. The search terms yoga, exercise, and gym were most correlated with changes in obesity and overweight prevalence in countries with the highest prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: Information-seeking patterns for diet- and exercise-related terms could indicate changes in attitudes toward and engagement in risk factors or healthy behaviors. These trends could capture population changes in risk factor prevalence, inform digital and physical interventions, and supplement official data from surveys.","publicationTitle":"JMIR Public Health Surveill","volume":"7","issue":"4","pages":"e24348","date":"2021-04","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Africa"},{"tag":"chronic diseases"},{"tag":"digital phenotype"},{"tag":"hypertension"},{"tag":"infodemiology"},{"tag":"infoveillance"},{"tag":"obesity"},{"tag":"overweight"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:14Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:14Z"}},{"key":"ZN8G57Q8","version":5,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/ZN8G57Q8","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/ZN8G57Q8","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Reynolds et al.","parsedDate":"2021-06","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"ZN8G57Q8","version":5,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Tobacco Use Prevalence and Transitions From 2013 to 2018 Among Adults With a History of Cardiovascular Disease","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Lindsay M","lastName":"Reynolds"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Cristian","lastName":"Zamora"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Un Jung","lastName":"Lee"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew C","lastName":"Stokes"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Emelia J","lastName":"Benjamin"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Aruni","lastName":"Bhatnagar"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Thomas J","lastName":"Payne"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Carlos J","lastName":"Rodriguez"}],"abstractNote":"Background Although tobacco product use and transitions have been characterized in the general population, few studies have focused on individuals with established cardiovascular disease (CVD) in a population-based sample. Methods and Results We examined tobacco use prevalence and longitudinal patterns of tobacco product transitions in adults ($\\geq$18 years) of the nationally representative PATH (Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health) study, from 2013 to 2014 (Wave 1) through 2016 to 2018 (Wave 4). Prevalent CVD was classified through self-report of having had a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, or other heart condition. Factors associated with tobacco product use and transitions were investigated using survey logistic regression. We examined 2615 participants with self-reported CVD at Wave 1. Overall, 28.9% reported current tobacco use, equating to $\\approx$6.2 million adults in the United States with prevalent CVD and current tobacco use. Among adults with CVD who are current tobacco users, the most commonly used product was cigarettes (82.8%), followed by any type of cigar (23.7%), and e-cigarette use (23.3%). E-cigarette use without concurrent cigarette use among participants with prevalent CVD was uncommon (1.1%). Factors associated with tobacco use were younger age, male sex, had lower education level, and lack of knowledge about the association between smoking and CVD. Men with prevalent CVD were less likely to use e-cigarettes compared with women (odds ratio [OR], 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5-0.9). Among cigarette users with CVD, transition rates between Waves 1 and 4 demonstrated <5% decrease in cigarette, with a 0.5% increase in e-cigarette use. Only $\\approx$10% were in formal tobacco cessation programs. Conclusions Despite known harmful cardiovascular effects, over one fourth of adults with prevalent CVD use tobacco products and few quit smoking over the 4 waves of the PATH data set.","publicationTitle":"J.

METHODS: Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, we categorized participants into weight-change categories based on their recalled weight during young adulthood and midlife. We estimated the association of weight change and developing an arthritis condition over 10 years using adjusted Cox models. Findings were extrapolated to the US population to determine the proportion of incident arthritis cases that could be averted if the entire population maintained a normal body mass index (BMI) in young adulthood and midlife. RESULTS: Among our sample of adults who were ages 40-69 years at their midlife weight measure (n = 13,669), 3,603 developed an arthritis condition. Compared with adults who maintained a normal-normal BMI, the normal-overweight, normal-obese, overweight-obese, and obese-obese groups had a significantly elevated risk of incident arthritis conditions. The obese-overweight group had a lower risk of incident arthritis conditions compared with the obese-obese group and a comparable risk to the overweight-overweight group. Nearly one-fourth of incident arthritis cases, corresponding to 2.7 million individuals, would have been averted under the hypothetical scenario where all individuals maintained normal weight from young adulthood to midlife. CONCLUSION: Weight loss from young adulthood to midlife was associated with a substantially reduced risk of developing an arthritis condition. We found no evidence of residual risk from having been heavier earlier in life. Our findings highlight the critical need to expand obesity treatment and prevention to achieve meaningful reductions in the burden of arthritis.","publicationTitle":"Arthritis Care Res.","volume":"73","issue":"3","pages":"318–327","date":"2021-03","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:14Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:14Z"}},{"key":"DGH7YI4X","version":5,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/DGH7YI4X","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/DGH7YI4X","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Stokes et al.","parsedDate":"2021-05","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"DGH7YI4X","version":5,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Racial/Ethnic Differences in Associations of Non-cigarette Tobacco Product Use With Subsequent Initiation of Cigarettes in US Youths","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew C","lastName":"Stokes"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Anna E","lastName":"Wilson"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Dielle J","lastName":"Lundberg"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Wubin","lastName":"Xie"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Kaitlyn M","lastName":"Berry"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jessica L","lastName":"Fetterman"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Alyssa F","lastName":"Harlow"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Yvette C","lastName":"Cozier"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jessica L","lastName":"Barrington-Trimis"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Kymberle L","lastName":"Sterling"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Emelia J","lastName":"Benjamin"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Michael J","lastName":"Blaha"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Naomi M","lastName":"Hamburg"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Aruni","lastName":"Bhatnagar"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Rose Marie","lastName":"Robertson"}],"abstractNote":"INTRODUCTION: Understanding which non-cigarette tobacco products precede smoking in youth across different racial/ethnic groups can inform policies that consider tobacco-related health disparities. METHODS: We used nationally representative, longitudinal data from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study waves 1-4. The sample was a dynamic cohort of cigarette-naïve youth aged 12-17 years. Mixed-effects models were used to assess non-cigarette product (e-cigarette, cigar product, or other product) use with cigarette use over 1-year intervals. RESULTS: Of the 28 788 observations pooled across waves 1-4, respondents were 48.7% non-Hispanic white, 13.9% non-Hispanic black, and 23.1% Hispanic. Odds of cigarette initiation over 1-year follow-up were higher among youth with prior use of e-cigarettes (odds ratio [OR], 2.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.21-3.45), cigars (OR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.42-2.80), or other products (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.28-2.14) compared to never users. At the population level, 20.6% of cigarette initiation was attributable to e-cigarette use among white youth and 21.6% among Hispanic youth, while only 3.5% of cigarette initiation was attributable to e-cigarette use among black youth. In contrast, 9.1% of cigarette initiation for black youth was attributable to cigar use compared to only 3.9% for both white and Hispanic youth. CONCLUSIONS: Prior use of e-cigarettes, cigars, and other non-cigarette products were all associated with subsequent cigarette initiation. However, white and Hispanic youth were more likely to initiate cigarettes through e-cigarette use (vs. cigar or other product use), while black youth were more likely to initiate cigarettes through cigar use (vs. e-cigarette or other product use). IMPLICATIONS: Our findings suggest that previous studies on effects of non-cigarette tobacco products may overlook the critical role of cigar products as a pathway into cigarette smoking among US youth, particularly black youth. While our data support the importance of e-cigarette use as a pathway into smoking, regulatory actions aimed at addressing youth e-cigarette use alone may contribute to disparities in black versus white tobacco use and further exacerbate inequities in tobacco-related disease. Thus, contemporary policy development and discourse about the effects of non-cigarette tobacco products on cigarette initiation should consider cigar and other non-cigarette products as well as e-cigarettes.","publicationTitle":"Nicotine Tob.

In the first wave of enrollment (2014-2017), electronic cigarette users reported their products as first, second and third generation devices (e-cig users) and were all largely current (i.e., dual) or former (sole) combustible cigarette users, whereas in the second wave of enrollment (2019-2020), electronic cigarette users all reported pod-based device use (pod users) and included more sole users who were never smokers. In multivariable-adjusted analyses comparing to never users, both sole e-cig users and combustible cigarette users had higher glucose and triglycerides and lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. Dual e-cig users showed higher triglycerides and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and lower HDL cholesterol compared to never users. In contrast, pod users (both sole and dual) had lipid profiles and glucose levels similar to never users. Overall, users of early generation electronic cigarettes display adverse metabolic profiles.

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we pooled individual-level data from nationally representative surveys across 57 LMICs. We identified all countries in which a WHO Stepwise Approach to Surveillance (STEPS) survey had been done during a year in which the country fell into an eligible World Bank income group category. For LMICs that did not have a STEPS survey, did not have valid contact information, or declined our request for data, we did a systematic search for survey datasets. Eligible surveys were done during or after 2008; had individual-level data; were done in a low-income, lower-middle-income, or upper-middle-income country; were nationally representative; had a response rate of 50% or higher; contained a diabetes biomarker (either a blood glucose measurement or glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c]); and contained data on height and weight. Diabetes was defined biologically as a fasting plasma glucose concentration of 7·0 mmol/L (126·0 mg/dL) or higher; a random plasma glucose concentration of 11·1 mmol/L (200·0 mg/dL) or higher; or a HbA1c of 6·5% (48·0 mmol/mol) or higher, or by self-reported use of diabetes medication. We included individuals aged 25 years or older with complete data on diabetes status, BMI (defined as normal [18·5-22·9 kg/m2], upper-normal [23·0-24·9 kg/m2], overweight [25·0-29·9 kg/m2], or obese [$\\geq$30·0 kg/m2]), sex, and age. Countries were categorised into six geographical regions: Latin America and the Caribbean, Europe and central Asia, east, south, and southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, Middle East and north Africa, and Oceania. We estimated the association between BMI and diabetes risk by multivariable Poisson regression and receiver operating curve analyses, stratified by sex and geographical region. FINDINGS: Our pooled dataset from 58 nationally representative surveys in 57 LMICs included 685 616 individuals. The overall prevalence of overweight was 27·2% (95% CI 26·6-27·8), of obesity was 21·0% (19·6-22·5), and of diabetes was 9·3% (8·4-10·2). In the pooled analysis, a higher risk of diabetes was observed at a BMI of 23 kg/m2 or higher, with a 43% greater risk of diabetes for men and a 41% greater risk for women compared with a BMI of 18·5-22·9 kg/m2. Diabetes risk also increased steeply in individuals aged 35-44 years and in men aged 25-34 years in sub-Saharan Africa. In the stratified analyses, there was considerable regional variability in this association. Optimal BMI thresholds for diabetes screening ranged from 23·8 kg/m2 among men in east, south, and southeast Asia to 28·3 kg/m2 among women in the Middle East and north Africa and in Latin America and the Caribbean. INTERPRETATION: The association between BMI and diabetes risk in LMICs is subject to substantial regional variability. Diabetes risk is greater at lower BMI thresholds and at younger ages than reflected in currently used BMI cutoffs for assessing diabetes risk. These findings offer an important insight to inform context-specific diabetes screening guidelines.

However, the association of long-term employment in ORs and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains unknown. Objective: To examine the association of working in an OR with incidence of COPD among female nurses in the US. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used data from the Nurses' Health Study for US female registered nurses who provided information on questionnaires regarding OR employment history in 1984 and job type in 1982 and who had no history of COPD in 1984 (baseline). Data analyses were conducted from April 1, 2020, to January 31, 2021. Exposures: Duration of nursing in the OR and job type. Main Outcomes and Measures: The associations of any employment as an OR nurse, duration of employment, and duration and job type with incidence of self-reported, physician-diagnosed COPD. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression models stratified by age and calendar year. Models were adjusted for covariates, with model 1 adjusting for age, model 2 also adjusting for cigarette smoking status and pack-year of smoking, and model 3 also adjusting for race and ethnicity, US Census region, and body mass index. Results: Among 75 011 female nurses included in the analyses, the mean (SD) age at baseline was 50.5 (7.2) years; 29% had a history of employment in an OR, and 3% had 15 or more years of OR experience. In model 3, employment in an OR for 15 or more years was associated with a 46% increased risk of developing COPD compared with no history of OR employment (HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.10-1.93). Compared with nurses who never worked in an OR and had an administrative or nursing education function or a nonnursing job in 1982, the risk of developing COPD was greater among nurses who provided outpatient care (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.04-1.47) and nurses employed in inpatient units (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.07-1.59) who had no history of OR employment and was 69% greater among nurses with OR experience of 15 years or more (HR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.25-2.28). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, OR employment of 15 years or more was associated with an increased risk of developing COPD among female nurses. Additional studies with more recent and direct environmental monitoring data of multiple occupational exposures are needed to assess the relative role of exposure to surgical smoke and disinfectants in the observed association.","publicationTitle":"JAMA Netw Open","volume":"4","issue":"9","pages":"e2125749","date":"2021-09","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:13Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:13Z"}},{"key":"LBK9F5SL","version":5,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/LBK9F5SL","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/LBK9F5SL","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Baker et al.","parsedDate":"2021-10","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"LBK9F5SL","version":5,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Obesity and the Risk of Incident Chronic Opioid Use in Rheumatoid Arthritis","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Joshua F","lastName":"Baker"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Stokes"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Sofia","lastName":"Pedro"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Ted R","lastName":"Mikuls"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Michael","lastName":"George"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Bryant R","lastName":"England"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Harlan","lastName":"Sayles"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Fred","lastName":"Wolfe"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Kaleb","lastName":"Michaud"}],"abstractNote":"OBJECTIVE: The present study was undertaken to evaluate whether the rate of incident chronic opioid use is higher in obese patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Participants with RA in the FORWARD databank were asked about their use of weak and strong opioid medications on semiannual surveys. Incident chronic opioid use was defined as new reported use extending over 2 contiguous surveys ( 7-12 months). Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate associations between body mass index (BMI) at enrollment and incident chronic opioid use (overall use and strong opioid use). Models adjusted for demographics, smoking, disease duration, RA treatments, household income, and education level. The predicted 5-year cumulative incidence was calculated from Cox models. RESULTS: Among 19,794 participants, 2,802 experienced an incident episode of chronic opioid use over 93,254 person-years of follow-up. Higher BMI was associated with higher risk of chronic opioid use. Severe obesity (BMI >35 kg/m2 ) was associated with a higher risk of overall use (adjusted hazard ratio [HRadj ] 1.74 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.72-2.04], P < 0.0001) and strong opioid use (HRadj 2.11 [95% CI 1.64-2.71], P < 0.001) compared to normal BMI. This association was partially explained by greater comorbidity, pain, and disability in obese groups. The attributable risk for obesity was 15% of overall opioid use and 24% of strong opioid use. CONCLUSION: Obesity is associated with a substantially higher risk of incident chronic opioid use. Approximately 1 in 4 cases of incident use of strong opioids may be attributable to obesity, suggesting a major public health impact. Interventions to prevent or reduce obesity could have an important impact on the use of opioids.","publicationTitle":"Arthritis Care Res.","volume":"73","issue":"10","pages":"1405–1412","date":"2021-10","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:13Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:13Z"}},{"key":"JQTU7V2C","version":5,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/JQTU7V2C","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/JQTU7V2C","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Busey et al.","parsedDate":"2021-12","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"JQTU7V2C","version":5,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Mortality following workplace injury: Quantitative bias analysis","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Busey"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Abay","lastName":"Asfaw"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Katie M","lastName":"Applebaum"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Paul K","lastName":"O'Leary"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Yorghos","lastName":"Tripodis"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Matthew P","lastName":"Fox"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew C","lastName":"Stokes"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Leslie I","lastName":"Boden"}],"abstractNote":"PURPOSE: Recent studies have shown increased all-cause mortality among workers following disabling workplace injury. These studies did not account for 2 potentially important confounders, smoking and obesity. We estimated injury-related mortality accounting for these factors. METHODS: We followed workers receiving New Mexico workers' compensation benefits (1994-2000) through 2013. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we derived the joint distribution of smoking status and obesity for workers with and without lost-time injuries. We conducted a quantitative bias analysis (QBA) to determine the adjusted relationship of injury and mortality. RESULTS: We observed hazard ratios after adjusting for smoking and obesity of 1.13 for women (95% simulation interval (SI) 0.97 to 1.31) and 1.12 for men (95% SI 1.00 to 1.27). The estimated fully adjusted excess hazard was about half the estimates not adjusted for these factors. CONCLUSIONS: Using QBA to adjust for smoking and obesity reduced the estimated mortality hazard from lost-time injuries and widened the simulation interval. The adjusted estimate still showed more than a 10 percent increase for both women and men. The change in estimates reveals the importance of accounting for these confounders. Of course, the results depend on the methods and assumptions used.","publicationTitle":"Ann.

We used 2017-2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data to estimate yearly prevalence and trends of past-30-day cannabis use and vaping among US adults. We used multivariable logistic regression to evaluate the associations of cannabis vaping with high-risk behaviors, asthma, and other respiratory symptoms. Our sample size was 160,209 (53,945-2017; 55,475-2018; and 50,789-2019). Past-30-day cannabis use prevalence increased from 10.0% (95% CI, 9.4%-10.7%) in 2017 to 13.4% (12.8%-12.0%) in 2019. Similarly, past-30-day cannabis vaping prevalence increased from 1.0% (0.8%-1.2%) to 2.0% (1.7%-2.2%) over the same period, with the greatest increase, 1.2% to 3.9%, observed among young adults (18-24 years). Individuals who vaped cannabis were more likely to concurrently vape nicotine. Cannabis vaping was associated with increased odds of heavy alcohol use (aOR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.45-2.63), binge drinking (aOR, 2.82; 95% CI, 2.25-3.54), and other high-risk behaviors (aOR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.89-3.24). In analyses adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and body mass index, cannabis vaping was not associated with asthma (aOR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.64-1.64) or other respiratory symptoms (aOR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.44-2.63). Adjusting for nicotine vaping did not substantively alter these associations. The prevalence of past-30-day cannabis vaping has increased, particularly among young adults, and was associated with high-risk behaviors. Although there was no association between cannabis vaping and asthma or other respiratory symptoms, the increasing trends of cannabis vaping, particularly among young adults, raise concern and underscore the need for continued surveillance.","publicationTitle":"Prev.

Given existing similarities in the constituents of e-cigarettes or ENDS and cigarettes, this study examines the association between ENDS use and erectile dysfunction. METHODS: Data from Wave 4 (2016-2018) of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health study were analyzed in 2020. Male participants aged $\\geq$20 years who responded to the erectile dysfunction question were included. Multivariable logistic regression models examined the association of ENDS use with erectile dysfunction within the full sample and in a restricted sample (adults aged 20-65 years with no previous cardiovascular disease diagnosis) while adjusting for multiple risk factors. RESULTS: The proportion of erectile dysfunction varied from 20.7% (full sample) to 10.2% (restricted sample). The prevalence of current ENDS use within the full and restricted samples was 4.8% and 5.6%, respectively, with 2.1% and 2.5%, respectively, reporting daily use. Current daily ENDS users were more likely to report erectile dysfunction than never users in both the full (AOR=2.24, 95% CI=1.50, 3.34) and restricted (AOR=2.41, 95% CI=1.55, 3.74) samples. In the full sample, cardiovascular disease history (versus not present) and age $\\geq$65 years (versus age 20-24 years) were associated with erectile dysfunction (AOR=1.39, 95% CI=1.10, 1.77; AOR= 17.4, 95% CI=12.15, 24.91), whereas physical activity was associated with lower odds of erectile dysfunction in both samples (AOR range=0.44-0.58). CONCLUSIONS: The use of ENDS seems to be associated with erectile dysfunction independent of age, cardiovascular disease, and other risk factors. While ENDS remain under evaluation for harm reduction and smoking-cessation potential, ENDS users should be informed about the possible association between ENDS use and erectile dysfunction.","publicationTitle":"Am.

Methods: Based on nationally representative samples of Americans aged 25-74 in 1995-1996 and 2011-2014, we use logistic regression to model period change in headaches, backaches, and joint aches as well as physical limitations and to determine whether those changes vary by a multidimensional measure of socioeconomic status. Results: Prevalence of backaches, joint aches, physical limitations, and obesity increased between the mid-1990s and the early 2010s, particularly among more disadvantaged Americans. Socioeconomic disparities in frequent backaches, frequent joint pain, and physical limitations more than doubled over this period. We estimate that obesity and health conditions may account for nearly a quarter of the widening disparity in frequent backaches and about half of the widening disparity in frequent joint pain and physical limitations. Discussion: Widening disparities in backaches, joint pain, and physical limitations have coincided with growing obesity.","publicationTitle":"J.

METHODS: We used data from the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study, a longitudinal cohort of older adults with or at risk of knee OA. Opioid use was identified by prescription medications and self-report. Obesity was defined as BMI $\\geq$ 30 kg/m2. Multi-joint pain was assessed using a standardized body homunculus, and depressive symptoms using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale. We quantified the direct and indirect effect of obesity on opioid use through the number of painful joints or depressive symptoms using causal mediation analysis by natural-effects models. RESULTS: We studied 2,335 participants (mean age: 68; mean BMI 31 kg/m2; 60% women). Persons with obesity had ∼50% higher odds of opioid use than those without. Estimates of indirect (mediated) effect by the number of painful joints and depressive symptoms suggested an increased odds of opioid use by 34% (odds ratio [OR] = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.70) and 35% (OR 1.35, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.71), respectively, in obese vs non-obese individuals. The total effect of obesity on opioid use was higher in women than in men. CONCLUSIONS: Multi-joint pain and depressive symptoms partially explained greater opioid use among obese persons with knee OA, demonstrating that the negative impact of obesity on knee OA extends beyond its influence on knee pain and structural progression.","publicationTitle":"Osteoarthritis Cartilage","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2022-06","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Depression"},{"tag":"Knee osteoarthritis"},{"tag":"Mediation analysis"},{"tag":"Obesity"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:12Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:12Z"}},{"key":"MNJRHZWQ","version":2,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/MNJRHZWQ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/MNJRHZWQ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Elo et al.","parsedDate":"2022-05","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"MNJRHZWQ","version":2,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Evaluation of Age Patterns of COVID-19 Mortality by Race and Ethnicity From March 2020 to October 2021 in the US","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Irma T","lastName":"Elo"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Anneliese","lastName":"Luck"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew C","lastName":"Stokes"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Katherine","lastName":"Hempstead"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Wubin","lastName":"Xie"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Samuel H","lastName":"Preston"}],"abstractNote":"","publicationTitle":"JAMA Netw Open","volume":"5","issue":"5","pages":"e2212686","date":"2022-05","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:11Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:11Z"}},{"key":"FG96YCUX","version":2,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/FG96YCUX","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/FG96YCUX","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Harlow et al.","parsedDate":"2022-07","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"FG96YCUX","version":2,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"e-Cigarette Use and Combustible Cigarette Smoking Initiation Among Youth: Accounting for Time-Varying Exposure and Time-Dependent Confounding","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Alyssa F","lastName":"Harlow"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew C","lastName":"Stokes"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Daniel R","lastName":"Brooks"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Emelia J","lastName":"Benjamin"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jessica L","lastName":"Barrington-Trimis"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Craig S","lastName":"Ross"}],"abstractNote":"BACKGROUND: Youth e-cigarette use is associated with the initiation of combustible cigarette smoking, but prior studies have rarely accounted for time-varying measures of e-cigarette exposure or time-dependent confounding of e-cigarette use and smoking initiation. METHODS: Using five waves of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (2013-2019), we estimated marginal structural models with inverse probability of treatment and censoring weights to examine the association between time-varying e-cigarette initiation and subsequent cigarette smoking initiation among e-cigarette- and cigarette-naïve youth (12-17 years) at baseline. Time-dependent confounders used as predictors in inverse probability weights included tobacco-related attitudes or beliefs, mental health symptoms, substance use, and tobacco-marketing exposure. RESULTS: Among 9,584 youth at baseline, those who initiated e-cigarettes were 2.4 times as likely to subsequently initiate cigarette smoking as youth who did not initiate e-cigarettes (risk ratio = 2.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.1, 2.7), after accounting for time-dependent confounding and selection bias. Among youth who initiated e-cigarettes, more frequent vaping was associated with greater risk of smoking initiation (risk ratio $\\geq$3 days/month = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.4, 2.2; 1-2 days/month = 1.2; 95% CI = 0.93, 1.6 vs. 0 days/month). Weighted marginal structural model estimates were moderately attenuated compared with unweighted estimates adjusted for baseline-only confounders. At the US population level, we estimated over half a million youth initiated cigarette smoking because of prior e-cigarette use over follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The association between youth vaping and combustible cigarette smoking persisted after accounting for time-dependent confounding. We estimate that e-cigarette use accounts for a considerable share of cigarette initiation among US youth.

We also assessed whether these associations are mediated by late life health. Results: BMI at age 54 was more strongly associated with late life mortality than BMI at older ages. The association between BMI change and mortality varied based on the timing of weight change. Health at age 72, particularly self-rated health, diabetes, and physical functioning, mediated the observed associations. Conclusion: Knowing older people's weight at midlife and how their weight has changed may be more important in assessing late life mortality risk than their current weight.","publicationTitle":"J.

Excess mortality, which compares observed deaths to deaths expected in the absence of the pandemic, is a useful measure for assessing the total effect of the pandemic on mortality levels. In the present study, we produce county-level estimates of excess mortality for 3,127 counties between March 2020 and December 2021. We fit two hierarchical linear models to county-level death rates from January 2015 to December 2019 and predict expected deaths for each month during the pandemic. We compare observed deaths to these estimates to obtain excess deaths for each county-month. An estimated 936,911 excess deaths occurred during 2020 and 2021, of which 171,168 (18.3%) were not assigned to Covid-19 on death certificates as an underlying cause of death. Urban counties in the Far West, Great Lakes, Mideast, and New England experienced a substantial mortality disadvantage in 2020, whereas rural counties in these regions had higher mortality in 2021. In the Southeast, Southwest, Rocky Mountain, and Plains regions, there was a rural mortality disadvantage in 2020, which was exacerbated in 2021. The proportion of excess deaths assigned to Covid-19 was lower in 2020 (76.3%) than in 2021 (87.0%), suggesting that a larger fraction of excess deaths was assigned to Covid-19 later in the pandemic. However, in rural areas and in the Southeast and Southwest a large share of excess deaths was still not assigned to Covid-19 during 2021. SIGNIFICANCE: Deaths during the Covid-19 pandemic have been primarily monitored through death certificates containing reference to Covid-19. This approach has missed more than 170,000 deaths related to the pandemic between 2020 and 2021. While the ascertainment of Covid-19 deaths improved during 2021, the full effects of the pandemic still remained obscured in some regions. County-level estimates of excess mortality are useful for studying geographic inequities in the mortality burden associated with the pandemic and identifying specific regions where the full mortality burden was significantly underreported (i.e. Southeast). They can also be used to inform resource allocation decisions at the federal and state levels and encourage uptake of preventive measures in communities with low vaccine uptake.","publicationTitle":"medRxiv","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2022-05","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2022-11-16T19:57:11Z","dateModified":"2022-11-16T19:57:11Z"}},{"key":"VTTCHKIV","version":2,"library":{"type":"user","id":10609530,"name":"aygerim","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/10609530/items/VTTCHKIV","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/aygerim/items/VTTCHKIV","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Berning et al.","parsedDate":"2022-04","numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"VTTCHKIV","version":2,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Association of Online Search Trends With Vaccination in the United States: June 2020 Through May 2021","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Philipp","lastName":"Berning"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Leu","lastName":"Huang"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Alexander C","lastName":"Razavi"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Ellen","lastName":"Boakye"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Ngozi","lastName":"Osuji"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew C","lastName":"Stokes"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Seth S","lastName":"Martin"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"John W","lastName":"Ayers"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Michael J","lastName":"Blaha"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Omar","lastName":"Dzaye"}],"abstractNote":"Stagnating COVID-19 vaccination rates and vaccine hesitancy remain a threat to public health. Improved strategies for real-time tracking and estimation of population-level behavior regarding vaccinations are needed. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether online search trends for COIVD-19 and influenza mirror vaccination rates. State-level weekly fraction of online searches for top vaccination-related search terms and CDC vaccination data were obtained from June 1, 2020, to May 31, 2021. Next, trends in online search and vaccination data for COVID-19 and influenza were analyzed for visual and quantitative correlation patterns using Spearman's rank correlation analysis. Online searches in the US for COVID-19 vaccinations increased 2.71-fold (95% CI: 1.98-3.45) in the 4 weeks after the FDA emergency authorization compared to the precedent 4 weeks. In March-April 2021, US online searches reached a plateau that was followed by a decline of 83.3% (95% CI: 31.2%-135.3%) until May 31, 2021. The timing of peaks in online searches varied across US states. Online searches were strongly correlated with vaccination rates (r=0.71, 95% CI: 0.45 - 0.87), preceding actual reported vaccination rates in 44 of 51 states. Online search trends preceded vaccination trends by a median of 3.0 weeks (95% CI: 2.0-4.0 weeks) across all states. For influenza vaccination searches, seasonal peaks in September-October between 2016-2020 were noted. Influenza search trends highly correlated with the timing of actual vaccinations for the 2019-2020 (r=0.82, 95% CI: 0.64 - 0.93) and 2020-2021 season (r=0.91, 95% CI: 0.78 - 0.97). Search trends and real-world vaccination rates are highly correlated. Temporal alignment and correlation levels were higher for influenza vaccinations; however, only online searches for COVID-19 vaccination preceded vaccination trends. These findings indicate that US online search data can potentially guide public health efforts, including policy changes and identifying geographical areas to expand vaccination campaigns.","publicationTitle":"Front.

However, longitudinal data assessing the association between e-cigarette use and respiratory symptoms are lacking. Objectives: To determine whether e-cigarette use is associated with the development of respiratory symptoms in young adults. Methods: Data are derived from the PATH (Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health) study waves 2 (2014-2015), 3 (2015-2016), 4 (2016-2018), and 5 (2018-2019). Young adults aged 18-24 years at baseline with no prevalent respiratory disease or symptoms were included in the analyses. Binary logistic regression models with a generalized estimating equation were used to estimate time-varying and time-lagged associations of e-cigarette use during waves 2-4, with respiratory symptom development approximately 12 months later at waves 3-5. Measurements and Main Results: The per-wave prevalence of former and current e-cigarette use was 15.2% and 5.6%, respectively. Former e-cigarette use was associated with higher odds of developing any respiratory symptom (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.39) and wheezing in the chest (aOR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.08-1.83) in multivariable adjusted models. Current e-cigarette use was associated with higher odds for any respiratory symptom (aOR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.06-1.65) and wheezing in the chest (aOR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.06-2.14). Associations persisted among participants who never smoked combustible cigarettes. Conclusions: In this nationally representative cohort of young adults, former and current e-cigarette use was associated with higher odds of developing wheezing-related respiratory symptoms, after accounting for cigarette smoking and other combustible tobacco product use.","publicationTitle":"Am.

However, evidence is limited as to whether smokeless tobacco (ST) use is associated with CVD. AIMS AND METHODS: Using data from 4347 adults in the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study (2013-2014), we compared geometric mean concentrations of CVD-related harm biomarkers and biomarkers of exposure among exclusive ST users and exclusive cigarette smokers-in relation to recent nicotine exposure-and never tobacco users, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, income, body mass index, and CVD. Biomarker levels among exclusive ST users who were former established cigarette smokers were compared with exclusive cigarette smokers. RESULTS: Compared with cigarette smokers, ST users had significantly higher concentrations of total nicotine equivalents (TNE) but lower concentrations of inflammatory (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, intercellular adhesion molecule, fibrinogen) and oxidative stress (8-isoprostane) biomarkers (all p < .05). Biomarker levels among ST users were similar to never smokers. ST users who were former cigarette smokers had lower levels of inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers and biomarkers of exposure (cadmium, lead, 1-hydroxypyrene, acrylonitrile, and acrolein), compared with cigarettes smokers (p < .05), despite having higher TNE levels (p < .05). Among cigarette smokers, but not among ST users, inflammatory biomarkers and TNE were highly correlated. CONCLUSIONS: ST use is not associated with increases in biomarkers of CVD-related harm and exposure, compared with never smokers, despite exposure to nicotine at levels higher than those observed among cigarette smokers. These findings support the concept that increases in CVD risk among cigarette smokers is caused primarily by constituents of tobacco smoke other than nicotine. IMPLICATIONS: Despite having higher levels of nicotine and compared with exclusive cigarette smokers, exclusive ST users (including those who were former cigarette smokers) had significantly lower concentrations of inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers, comparable to levels observed among never tobacco users. These findings suggest that increases in CVD risk among cigarette smokers is caused primarily by tobacco constituents other than nicotine and that switching to ST is likely associated with lower CVD risk.","publicationTitle":"Nicotine Tob.
